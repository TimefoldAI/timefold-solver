        Here, that distinction is not supported because it would cause a memory leak.

        Waits for the termination or cancellation to complete before returning.
        During termination, a `best_solution_consumer` could still be called.
        When the solver terminates, the `final_best_solution_consumer` is executed with the latest best solution.
        These consumers run on a consumer thread independently of the termination
        and may still run even after this method returns.

        Parameters
        ----------
        problem_id : ProblemId_
            A value given to `SolverManager.solve`, `SolverManager.solve_and_listen` or
            `SolverJobBuilder.with_problem_id`.

        self._delegate.terminateEarly(convert_to_java_python_like_object(problem_id))

    def add_problem_change(self, problem_id: ProblemId_, problem_change: ProblemChange[Solution_]) -> Awaitable[None]:
        """
        Schedules a `ProblemChange` to be processed by the underlying `Solver` and returns immediately.
        If the solver already terminated or the `problem_id` was never added, throws an exception.
        The same applies if the underlying `Solver` is not in the `SolverStatus.SOLVING_ACTIVE` state.

        Parameters
        ----------
        problem_id : ProblemId_
            A value given to `SolverManager.solve`, `SolverManager.solve_and_listen` or
            `SolverJobBuilder.with_problem_id`.
        problem_change : ProblemChange
            A problem change to be processed by the underlying `Solver`.

        Returns
        -------
        Awaitable
            An awaitable that completes after the best solution containing this change has been consumed.
