/**
 * Provides the constraints for the conference scheduling problem.

 * Makes heavy use of CS expand() functionality to cache computation results,
 * except in cases where doing so less is efficient than recomputing the result.
 * That is the case in filtering joiners.
 * In this case, it is better to reduce the size of the joins even at the expense of duplicating some calculations.
 * In other words, time saved by caching those calculations is far outweighed by the time spent in unrestricted joins.
