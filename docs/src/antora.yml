# This file is a template for antora.yml.
# During a release, Maven substitutes the properties and stores result into target/antora-template.yml.
# That file is then copied to src/modules/antora.yml and committed to Git on the release branch.
# The timefold.ai website can then be refreshed from the release branch and/or tag.

# This is a workaround to be able to build the docs from main branch,
# because 1.9.0 tag has a critical docs bug and we don't want to re-release the solver just because of the docs.
# Remove this file when releasing Solver 1.10.0.
