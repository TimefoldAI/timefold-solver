# This file is a template for antora.yml, which is created during a release by:
#   1. running maven that substitutes the properties into this file
#   2. running build/release/update_antora_yml.sh that copies the result of the previous step to src/antora.yml
#
# The goal is to have the antora.yml containing correct attributes available in the release branch before
# the timefold-solver-website is refreshed.
