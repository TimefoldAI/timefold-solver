[#basicMoveSelectors]
== Move selectors for basic variables

These moves are applicable to planning variables that aren’t part of a list or a chain,
also called xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningVariable[basic variables].

[#changeMoveSelector]
=== `ChangeMoveSelector`

For one planning variable, the `ChangeMove` selects one planning entity and one planning value and assigns the entity's variable to that value.

image::optimization-algorithms/move-selector-reference/changeMove.png[align="center"]

Simplest configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <changeMoveSelector/>
----

If there are multiple entity classes or multiple planning variables for one entity class,
a simple configuration will automatically unfold into
an xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#unionMoveSelector[union]
of `ChangeMove` selectors for every planning variable.

Advanced configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <changeMoveSelector>
      ... <!-- Normal selector properties -->
      <entitySelector>
        <entityClass>...Lecture</entityClass>
        ...
      </entitySelector>
      <valueSelector variableName="room">
        ...
      </valueSelector>
    </changeMoveSelector>
----

A `ChangeMove` is the finest grained move.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Almost every `moveSelector` configuration injected into a metaheuristic algorithm should include a `changeMoveSelector`.
This guarantees that every possible solution can be reached in theory through applying a number of moves in sequence.
Of course, normally it is unioned with other, more coarse grained move selectors.
====

This move selector only supports xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#cacheType[phase or solver caching] 
if it doesn't apply on a xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#chainedPlanningVariable[chained] variable.


[#swapMoveSelector]
=== `SwapMoveSelector`

The `SwapMove` selects two different planning entities and swaps the planning values of all their planning variables.

image::optimization-algorithms/move-selector-reference/swapMove.png[align="center"]

Although a `SwapMove` on a single variable is essentially just two ``ChangeMove``s,
it's often the winning step in cases that the first of the two ``ChangeMove``s would not win
because it leaves the solution in a state with broken hard constraints.
For example: swapping the room of two lectures doesn't bring the solution in an intermediate state where both lectures are in the same room which breaks a hard constraint.

Simplest configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <swapMoveSelector/>
----

If there are multiple entity classes, a simple configuration will automatically unfold 
into an xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#unionMoveSelector[union] 
of `SwapMove` selectors for every entity class.

Advanced configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <swapMoveSelector>
      ... <!-- Normal selector properties -->
      <entitySelector>
        <entityClass>...Lecture</entityClass>
        ...
      </entitySelector>
      <secondaryEntitySelector>
        <entityClass>...Lecture</entityClass>
        ...
      </secondaryEntitySelector>
      <variableNameIncludes>
        <variableNameInclude>room</variableNameInclude>
        <variableNameInclude>...</variableNameInclude>
      </variableNameIncludes>
    </swapMoveSelector>
----

The `secondaryEntitySelector` is rarely needed: if it is not specified, entities from the same `entitySelector` are swapped.

If one or more `variableNameInclude` properties are specified, not all planning variables will be swapped, but only those specified.

This move selector only supports xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#cacheType[phase or solver caching]
if it doesn't apply on any xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#chainedPlanningVariable[chained] variables.

[#pillarMoveSelectors]
=== Pillar-based move selectors

A _pillar_ is a set of planning entities which have the same planning value(s) for their planning variable(s).

[#pillarChangeMoveSelector]
==== `PillarChangeMoveSelector`

The `PillarChangeMove` selects one entity pillar (or subset of those) and changes the value of one variable (which is the same for all entities) to another value.

image::optimization-algorithms/move-selector-reference/pillarChangeMove.png[align="center"]

In the example above, queen A and C have the same value (row 0) and are moved to row 2.
Also the yellow and blue process have the same value (computer Y) and are moved to computer X.

        ...
      </valueSelector>
    </pillarChangeMoveSelector>
----

For a description of `subPillarType` and related properties, please refer to <<subPillars,Sub-pillars>>.

The other properties are explained in <<changeMoveSelector,changeMoveSelector>>.
This move selector doesn’t support xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#cacheType[phase or solver caching]
and step caching scales badly memory wise.


[#pillarSwapMoveSelector]
==== `PillarSwapMoveSelector`

The `PillarSwapMove` selects two different entity pillars and swaps the values of all their variables for all their entities.

        <variableNameInclude>employee</variableNameInclude>
        <variableNameInclude>...</variableNameInclude>
      </variableNameIncludes>
    </pillarSwapMoveSelector>
----

For a description of `subPillarType` and related properties, please refer to <<subPillars,sub-pillars>>.

The `secondaryPillarSelector` is rarely needed: if it is not specified, entities from the same `pillarSelector` are swapped.

The other properties are explained in <<swapMoveSelector,swapMoveSelector>> and <<pillarChangeMoveSelector,pillarChangeMoveSelector>>.
This move selector doesn’t support xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#cacheType[phase or solver caching]
and step caching scales badly memory wise.

[#subPillars]
==== Sub-pillars

A sub-pillar is a subset of entities that share the same value(s) for their variable(s).
For example if queen A, B, C and D are all located on row 0, they’re a pillar and `[A, D]` is one of the many sub-pillars.

There are several ways how sub-pillars can be selected by the `subPillarType` property:

- `ALL` (default) selects all possible sub-pillars.
- `SEQUENCE` limits selection of sub-pillars to <<sequentialSubPillars,Sequential sub-pillars>>.
- `NONE` never selects any sub-pillars.

If sub-pillars are enabled, the pillar itself is also included and the properties `minimumSubPillarSize` (defaults to ``1``) and `maximumSubPillarSize` (defaults to ``infinity``) limit the size of the selected (sub) pillar.

[NOTE]
====
The number of sub-pillars of a pillar is exponential to the size of the pillar.
For example a pillar of size 32 has `(2^32 - 1)` sub-pillars.
Therefore a `pillarSelector` only supports xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#justInTimeRandomSelection[JIT random selection] (which is the default).
====

[#sequentialSubPillars]
===== Sequential sub-pillars

sub-pillars can be sorted with a `Comparator`. A sequential sub-pillar is a continuous subset of its sorted base pillar.

For example, if an employee has shifts on Monday (`M`), Tuesday (`T`), and Wednesday (`W`),
they’re a pillar and only the following are its sequential sub-pillars: `[M], [T], [W], [M, T], [T, W], [M, T, W]`.
But `[M, W]` is not a sub-pillar in this case, as there is a gap on Tuesday.

Sequential sub-pillars apply to both <<pillarChangeMoveSelector,Pillar change move>> and
<<pillarSwapMoveSelector,Pillar swap move>>. A minimal configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <pillar...MoveSelector>
      <subPillarType>SEQUENCE</subPillarType>
    </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

In this case, the entity being operated on must implement the `Comparable` interface. The size of sub-pillars will not be limited in any way.

An advanced configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <pillar...MoveSelector>
      ...
      <subPillarType>SEQUENCE</subPillarType>
      <subPillarSequenceComparatorClass>...ShiftComparator</subPillarSequenceComparatorClass>
      <pillarSelector>
        ...
        <minimumSubPillarSize>1</minimumSubPillarSize>
        <maximumSubPillarSize>1000</maximumSubPillarSize>
      </pillarSelector>
      ...
    </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

In this case, the entity being operated on needn’t be `Comparable`.
The given `subPillarSequenceComparatorClass` is used to establish the sequence instead.
Also, the size of the sub-pillars is limited in length of up to 1000 entities.

[#ruinRecreateMoveSelector]
=== `RuinRecreateMoveSelector`

The `RuinRecreateMove` selects a subset of entities and sets their values to null,
effectively unassigning them.
Then it runs a construction heuristic to assign them again.
If xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningVariableAllowingUnassigned[unassigned values] are allowed,
it may leave them unassigned.

This coarse-grained move is useful to help the solver to escape from a local optimum.
It allows the solver to effectively "undo" a number of earlier decisions in one step,
opening up a new part of the solution space.

[NOTE]
====
If xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#nearbySelection[nearby selection] is enabled,
the `RuinRecreateMove` is likely to underperform
as it won't be able to rebuild the solution using nearby selection.
This almost always results in worse solutions than those that were originally ruined,
without a big likelihood of leading to a better solution further down the line.
We recommend not using this move together with nearby selection.
====

This move is not enabled by default.
To enable it, add the following to the `localSearch` section of the solver configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <ruinRecreateMoveSelector/>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The default values have been determined by extensive benchmarking.
That said, the optimal values may vary depending on the problem, available solving time, and dataset at hand.
We recommend that you xref:using-timefold-solver/benchmarking-and-tweaking.adoc#benchmarker[experiment with these values]
to find the best fit for your problem.
====

Advanced configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <ruinRecreateMoveSelector>
      <minimumRuinedCount>5</minimumRuinedCount>
      <maximumRuinedCount>40</maximumRuinedCount>
    </ruinRecreateMoveSelector>
----

The `minimumRuinedCount` and `maximumRuinedCount` properties limit the number of entities that are unassigned.
The default values are `5` and `20` respectively, but for large datasets,
it may prove beneficial to increase these values.

[NOTE]
====
`RuinRecreateMove` doesn’t support customizing the construction heuristic that it runs.
Neither does it support customizing any entity or value selectors.
If your problem needs more control over the construction heuristic,
don’t enable this move.
====

Since the `RuinRecreateMove` is a coarse-grained move,
it is expensive and can slow the solver down significantly.
However, the default local search configuration will attempt to run it at the same frequency
as the other fine-grained moves.
For that reason, we recommend that you use xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#probabilisticSelection[probabilistic selection]
to control the frequency of this move:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <unionMoveSelector>
        <unionMoveSelector>
            <fixedProbabilityWeight>100.0</fixedProbabilityWeight>
            <changeMoveSelector/>
            <swapMoveSelector/>
            <pillarChangeMoveSelector/>
            <pillarSwapMoveSelector/>
        </unionMoveSelector>
        <ruinMoveSelector>
            <fixedProbabilityWeight>1.0</fixedProbabilityWeight>
        </ruinMoveSelector>
    </unionMoveSelector>
----

The above configuration will run the `RuinRecreateMove` once for every 100 fine-grained moves.
As always, benchmarking is recommended to find the optimal value for your use case.


[#listMoveSelectors]
== Move selectors for list variables

These moves are applicable to xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningListVariable[list planning variables].

[#listChangeMoveSelector]
=== `ListChangeMoveSelector`

The `ListChangeMoveSelector` selects an element from a list variable's value range and moves it from its current position to a new one.

Simplest configuration:

[source,xml]
----
    <listSwapMoveSelector/>
----

[#subListChangeMoveSelector]
=== `SubListChangeMoveSelector`

A _subList_ is a sequence of elements in a specific entity's list variable between `fromIndex` and `toIndex`.
The `SubListChangeMoveSelector` selects a source subList by selecting a source entity and the source subList's `fromIndex` and `toIndex`.
Then it selects a destination entity and a `destinationIndex` in the destination entity's list variable.
Selecting these parameters results in a `SubListChangeMove` that removes the source subList elements from the source entity and adds them to the destination entity's list variable at the `destinationIndex`.

Simplest configuration:

      </subListSelector>
    </subListChangeMoveSelector>
----

[#subListSwapMoveSelector]
=== `SubListSwapMoveSelector`

A _subList_ is a sequence of elements in a specific entity's list variable between `fromIndex` and `toIndex`.
The `SubListSwapMoveSelector` selects a left subList by selecting a left entity and the left subList's `fromIndex` and `toIndex`.
Then it selects a right subList by selecting a right entity and the right subList's `fromIndex` and `toIndex`.
Selecting these parameters results in a `SubListSwapMove` that swaps the right and left subLists between right and left entities.

----

[#kOptListMoveSelector]
=== `KOptListMoveSelector`

The `KOptListMoveSelector` considers the list variable to be
a graph whose edges are the consecutive elements of the list
(with the last element being consecutive to the first element).
A `KOptListMove` selects an entity, remove `k` edges from its list variable, and add `k` new edges from the removed edges' endpoints.
This move may reverse segments of the graph.

----

[#listRuinRecreateMoveSelector]
=== `ListRuinRecreateMoveSelector`

The `ListRuinRecreateMove` selects a subset of values, and removes them from their list variables.
Then it runs a construction heuristic to assign them again.
If xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningListVariableAllowingUnassigned[unassigned values] are allowed,
it may leave them unassigned.

This coarse-grained move is useful to help the solver to escape from a local optimum.
It allows the solver to effectively "undo" a number of earlier decisions in one step,

This move is not enabled by default.
To enable it, add the following to the `localSearch` section of the solver configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <listRuinRecreateMoveSelector/>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The default values have been determined by extensive benchmarking.
That said, the optimal values may vary depending on the problem, available solving time, and dataset at hand.
We recommend that you xref:using-timefold-solver/benchmarking-and-tweaking.adoc#benchmarker[experiment with these values]

      <minimumRuinedCount>5</minimumRuinedCount>
      <maximumRuinedCount>40</maximumRuinedCount>
    </listRuinRecreateMoveSelector>
----

The `minimumRuinedCount` and `maximumRuinedCount` properties limit the number of values that are unassigned.
The default values are `5` and `20` respectively, but for large datasets,
it may prove beneficial to increase these values.

[NOTE]
====
`ListRuinRecreateMove` doesn’t support customizing the construction heuristic that it runs.
Neither does it support customizing any entity or value selectors.
If your problem needs more control over the construction heuristic,
don’t enable this move.
====

Since the `ListRuinRecreateMove` is a coarse-grained move,
it is expensive and can slow the solver down significantly.
However, the default local search configuration will attempt to run it at the same frequency
as the other fine-grained moves.
For that reason, we recommend that you use xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#probabilisticSelection[probabilistic selection]
to control the frequency of this move:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]

----

The above configuration will run the `ListRuinRecreateMove` once for every 100 fine-grained moves.
As always, benchmarking is recommended to find the optimal value for your use case.


[#chainMoveSelectors]
== Move selectors for chained variables

These moves are applicable to xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#chainedPlanningVariable[chained planning variable].

[#tailChainSwapMoveSelector]
=== `TailChainSwapMoveSelector` or 2-opt

A _tailChain_ is a set of planning entities with a chained planning variable which form the last part of a chain.
The `tailChainSwapMove` selects a tail chain and swaps it with the tail chain of another planning value (in a different or the same anchor chain). If the targeted planning value, doesn't have a tail chain, it swaps with nothing (resulting in a change like move). If it occurs within the same anchor chain, a partial chain reverse occurs.
In academic papers, this is often called a 2-opt move.

Simplest configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <tailChainSwapMoveSelector/>
----

Advanced configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <tailChainSwapMoveSelector>
      ... <!-- Normal selector properties -->
      <entitySelector>
        <entityClass>...Customer</entityClass>
        ...
      </entitySelector>
      <valueSelector variableName="previousStandstill">
        ...
      </valueSelector>
    </tailChainSwapMoveSelector>
----

The `entitySelector` selects the start of the tail chain that is being moved.
The `valueSelector` selects to where that tail chain is moved.
If it has a tail chain itself, that is moved to the location of the original tail chain.
It uses a `valueSelector` instead of a `secondaryEntitySelector`
to be able
to include all possible 2opt moves (such as moving to the end of a tail)
and to work correctly with xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#nearbySelection[nearby selection]
(because of asymmetric distances and also swapped entity distance gives an incorrect selection probability).

[NOTE]
====
Although `subChainChangeMoveSelector` and `subChainSwapMoveSelector` include almost every possible ``tailChainSwapMove``, experiments have shown that focusing on ``tailChainSwapMove``s increases efficiency.
====

This move selector doesn’t support xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#cacheType[phase or solver caching].

[#subChainChangeMoveSelector]
=== `SubChainChangeMoveSelector`

A _subChain_ is a set of planning entities with a chained planning variable which form part of a chain.
The `subChainChangeMoveSelector` selects a subChain and moves it to another place (in a different or the same anchor chain).

Simplest configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <subChainChangeMoveSelector/>
----

Advanced configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <subChainChangeMoveSelector>
      ... <!-- Normal selector properties -->
      <entityClass>...Customer</entityClass>
      <subChainSelector>
        <valueSelector variableName="previousStandstill">
          ...

        <maximumSubChainSize>40</maximumSubChainSize>
      </subChainSelector>
      <valueSelector variableName="previousStandstill">
        ...
      </valueSelector>
      <selectReversingMoveToo>true</selectReversingMoveToo>
    </subChainChangeMoveSelector>
----

The `subChainSelector` selects a number of entities, no less than `minimumSubChainSize` (defaults to ``1``) and no more than `maximumSubChainSize` (defaults to ``infinity``).

[NOTE]
====
If `minimumSubChainSize` is `1` (which is the default), this selector might select the same move as a ``ChangeMoveSelector``, at a far lower selection probability (because each move _type_ has the same selection chance by default (not every move instance) and there are far more `SubChainChangeMove` instances than `ChangeMove` instances). However, don't just remove the ``ChangeMoveSelector``, because experiments show that it's good to focus on ``ChangeMove``s.

Furthermore, in a ``SubChainSwapMoveSelector``, setting `minimumSubChainSize` prevents swapping a subchain of size `1` with a subchain of size ``2`` or more.
====

The `selectReversingMoveToo` property (defaults to true) enables selecting the reverse of every subchain too.

This move selector doesn’t support xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#cacheType[phase or solver caching]
and step caching scales badly memory wise.


[#subChainSwapMoveSelector]
=== `SubChainSwapMoveSelector`

The `subChainSwapMoveSelector` selects two different subChains and moves them to another place in a different or the same anchor chain.

Simplest configuration:

      <entityClass>...Customer</entityClass>
      <subChainSelector>
        <valueSelector variableName="previousStandstill">
          ...
        </valueSelector>
        <minimumSubChainSize>2</minimumSubChainSize>
        <maximumSubChainSize>40</maximumSubChainSize>
      </subChainSelector>
      <secondarySubChainSelector>
        <valueSelector variableName="previousStandstill">
          ...
        </valueSelector>
        <minimumSubChainSize>2</minimumSubChainSize>
        <maximumSubChainSize>40</maximumSubChainSize>
      </secondarySubChainSelector>
      <selectReversingMoveToo>true</selectReversingMoveToo>
    </subChainSwapMoveSelector>

The `secondarySubChainSelector` is rarely needed: if it is not specified, entities from the same `subChainSelector` are swapped.

The other properties are explained in <<subChainChangeMoveSelector,subChainChangeMoveSelector>>.
