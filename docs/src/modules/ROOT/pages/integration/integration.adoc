[#integrationOverview]
== Overview

Timefold Solver's input and output data (the planning problem and the best solution) are plain old JavaBeans (POJOs), so integration with other Java technologies is straightforward.
For example:

* To read a planning problem from the database (and store the best solution in it), annotate the domain POJOs with JPA annotations.
* To read a planning problem from an XML file (and store the best solution in it), annotate the domain POJOs with JAXB annotations.
* To expose the Solver as a REST Service that reads the planning problem and responds with the best solution, annotate the domain POJOs with JAXB or Jackson annotations and hook the `Solver` in RESTEasy.

[NOTE]
====
In Python, Timefold Solver's input and output data (the planning problem and the best solution) are Python objects (that are defined in a Python source file, and not a C extension).

[#integrationWithPersistentStorage]
== Persistent storage


[#integrationWithJpaAndHibernate]
=== Database: JPA and Hibernate

Enrich domain POJOs (solution, entities and problem facts) with JPA annotations
to store them in a database by calling `EntityManager.persist()`.

[NOTE]
====
Do not confuse JPA's `@Entity` annotation with Timefold Solver's `@PlanningEntity` annotation.
They can appear both on the same class:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningEntity // Timefold Solver annotation
@Entity // JPA annotation
public class Talk {...}
----
====

[#jpaAndHibernatePersistingAScore]
==== JPA and Hibernate: persisting a `Score`

The `timefold-solver-jpa` jar provides a JPA score converter for every built-in score type.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
@Entity
public class VehicleRoutePlan {

    @PlanningScore
    @Convert(converter = HardSoftScoreConverter.class)
    protected HardSoftScore score;

    ...
}
----

Please note that the converters make JPA and Hibernate serialize the score in a single `VARCHAR` column.
This has the disadvantage that the score cannot be used in a SQL or JPA-QL query to efficiently filter the results, for example to query all infeasible schedules.

To avoid this limitation, https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#embeddable-mapping-custom[implement the `CompositeUserType`] to persist each score level into a separate database table column.

[#jpaAndHibernatePlanningCloning]
==== JPA and Hibernate: planning cloning

In JPA and Hibernate, there is usually a `@ManyToOne` relationship from most problem fact classes to the planning solution class.
Therefore, the problem fact classes reference the planning solution class,
which implies that when the solution is xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#cloningASolution[planning cloned], they need to be cloned too.
Use an `@DeepPlanningClone` on each such problem fact class to enforce that:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution // Timefold Solver annotation
@Entity // JPA annotation
public class Conference {

    @OneToMany(mappedBy="conference")
    private List<Room> roomList;

    ...
}
----

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@DeepPlanningClone // Timefold Solver annotation: Force the default planning cloner to planning clone this class too
@Entity // JPA annotation
public class Room {

    @ManyToOne
    private Conference conference; // Because of this reference, this problem fact needs to be planning cloned too

}
----

Neglecting to do this can lead to persisting duplicate solutions, JPA exceptions or other side effects.


[#integrationWithJaxb]
=== XML or JSON: JAXB

Enrich domain POJOs (solution, entities and problem facts) with JAXB annotations to serialize them to/from XML or JSON.

Add a dependency to the `timefold-solver-jaxb` jar to take advantage of these extra integration features:

[#jaxbMarshallingAScore]
==== JAXB: marshalling a `Score`

When a `Score` is marshalled to XML or JSON by the default JAXB configuration, it's corrupted.
To fix that, configure the appropriate ``ScoreJaxbAdapter``:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
@XmlRootElement @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class VehicleRoutePlan {

    @PlanningScore
    @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(HardSoftScoreJaxbAdapter.class)
    private HardSoftScore score;

    ...
}
----

For example, this generates pretty XML:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<vehicleRoutePlan>
   ...
   <score>0hard/-200soft</score>
</vehicleRoutePlan>
----

The same applies for a bendable score:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
@XmlRootElement @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Schedule {

    @PlanningScore
    @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(BendableScoreJaxbAdapter.class)
    private BendableScore score;

    ...
}
----

For example, with a `hardLevelsSize` of `2` and a `softLevelsSize` of `3`, that will generate:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<schedule>
   ...
   <score>[0/0]hard/[-100/-20/-3]soft</score>
</schedule>
----

The `hardLevelsSize` and `softLevelsSize` implied, when reading a bendable score from an XML element, must always be in sync with those in the solver.


[#integrationWithJackson]
=== JSON: Jackson

Enrich domain POJOs (solution, entities and problem facts) with Jackson annotations to serialize them to/from JSON.

Add a dependency to the `timefold-solver-jackson` jar and register `TimefoldJacksonModule`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
objectMapper.registerModule(TimefoldJacksonModule.createModule());
----


[#jacksonMarshallingAScore]
==== Jackson: marshalling a `Score`

When a `Score` is marshalled to/from JSON by the default Jackson configuration, it fails.
The `TimefoldJacksonModule` fixes that, by using `HardSoftScoreJacksonSerializer`,
`HardSoftScoreJacksonDeserializer`, etc.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class VehicleRoutePlan {

    @PlanningScore
    private HardSoftScore score;

    ...
}
----

For example, this generates:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
   "score":"0hard/-200soft"
   ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
When reading a `BendableScore`, the `hardLevelsSize` and `softLevelsSize` implied in the JSON element,
must always be in sync with those defined in the `@PlanningScore` annotation in the solution class.For example:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
   "score":"[0/0]hard/[-100/-20/-3]soft"
   ...
}
----

This JSON implies the `hardLevelsSize` is 2 and the `softLevelsSize` is 3,
which must be in sync with the `@PlanningScore` annotation:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class Schedule {

    @PlanningScore(bendableHardLevelsSize = 2, bendableSoftLevelsSize = 3)
    private BendableScore score;

    ...
}
----
====

When a field is the `Score` supertype (instead of a specific type such as `HardSoftScore`),
it uses `PolymorphicScoreJacksonSerializer` and `PolymorphicScoreJacksonDeserializer` to record the score type in JSON too,
otherwise it would be impossible to deserialize it:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class VehicleRoutePlan {

    @PlanningScore
    private Score score;

    ...
}
----

For example, this generates:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
   "score":{"HardSoftScore":"0hard/-200soft"}
   ...
}
----

[#integrationWithPydantic]
=== JSON: Pydantic/FastAPI

Enrich domain objects (solution, entities and problem facts) with Pydantic annotations to serialize them to/from JSON (allowing them to directly be used in routes such as in FastAPI).

The score classes are dataclasses and will use the default serialization/deserialization provided by Pydantic and FastAPI.
To serialize to the score string instead of a JSON object with attributes for each score level, use a custom Serializer/Validator:

[source,python,options="nowrap"]
----
from timefold.solver.domain import planning_solution, PlanningScore
from timefold.solver.score import HardSoftScore
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import BaseModel, PlainSerializer, BeforeValidator, ValidationInfo, Field

ScoreSerializer = PlainSerializer(lambda score: str(score) if score is not None else None,
                                  return_type=str | None)


def validate_score(v: Any, info: ValidationInfo) -> Any:
    if isinstance(v, HardSoftScore) or v is None:
        return v
    if isinstance(v, str):
        return HardSoftScore.parse(v)
    raise ValueError('"score" should be a string')


ScoreValidator = BeforeValidator(validate_score)


@planning_solution
class Solution(BaseModel):
    score: Annotated[HardSoftScore | None,
                     PlanningScore,
                     ScoreSerializer,
                     ScoreValidator,
                     Field(default=None)]
    # ...Other attributes and methods...
----

If your domain objects can reference each other, a custom validator should be used, so they will deserialize to the same object.
For example, with FastAPI:

[source,python,options="nowrap"]
----
from datetime import time
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Request
from timefold.solver.domain import planning_entity, planning_solution, PlanningVariable, PlanningId
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import BaseModel, PlainSerializer, BeforeValidator, ValidationInfo, Field

app = FastAPI()

IdSerializer = PlainSerializer(lambda item: item.id if item is not None else None,
return_type=str | None)


def make_list_item_validator(key: str):
    def validator(v: Any, info: ValidationInfo) -> Any:
        if v is None:
            return None

        if not isinstance(v, str) or not info.context:
            return v

        return info.context.get(key)[v]

    return BeforeValidator(validator)


RoomDeserializer = make_list_item_validator('rooms')
TimeslotDeserializer = make_list_item_validator('timeslots')


class Timeslot(BaseModel):
    id: Annotated[str, PlanningId]
    day_of_week: str
    start_time: time
    end_time: time


class Room(BaseModel):
    id: Annotated[str, PlanningId]
    name: str


@planning_entity

    subject: str
    teacher: str
    student_group: str
    timeslot: Annotated[Timeslot | None,
                        PlanningVariable,
                        IdSerializer,
                        TimeslotDeserializer,
                        Field(default=None)]
    room: Annotated[Room | None,
                    PlanningVariable,
                    IdSerializer,
                    RoomDeserializer,
                    Field(default=None)]


@planning_solution
class Timetable(BaseModel):

                                            room['id']: Room.model_validate(room) for room in json.get('rooms', [])
                                        },
                                        'timeslots': {

                                    })


@app.put("/timetables/analyze")
async def analyze_timetable(timetable: Annotated[Timetable, Depends(setup_context)]) -> HardSoftScore:
    ...
----

Neglecting to do this can lead to incorrect score analysis and score calculation.

[#integrationWithQuarkus]
== Quarkus

To use Timefold Solver with Quarkus, read the xref:quickstart/quarkus/quarkus-quickstart.adoc#quarkusQuickStart[Quarkus Java quick start].
If you are starting a new project, visit the https://code.quarkus.io/[code.quarkus.io] and select
the _Timefold AI constraint solver_ extension before generating your application.

[#integrationWithQuarkusProperties]
=== Available configuration properties

Following properties are supported in the Quarkus `application.properties`:

:property_prefix: quarkus.
:solver_name_prefix:

[#integrationWithQuarkusManagedResources]
=== Injecting managed resources

The Quarkus integration allows the injection of several managed resources, including `SolverConfig`, `SolverFactory`,
`SolverManager`, `SolutionManager`, `ScoreManager`, `ConstraintVerifier` and `ConstraintMetaModel`.

The `SolverConfig` resource is constructed by reading the `application.properties` file and classpath. Therefore, Domain entities
(solution, entities, and constraint classes) and customized properties (`spent-limit`, `domain-access-type`, etc.) for the
planning problem are identified and loaded into the solver configuration.

The available resouses can be injected as follows:

[#integrationWithQuarkusMultipleResources]
=== Injecting multiple instances of `SolverManager`

Quarkus extension allows for defining different solver settings or even wholly distinct planning problems in the same
application. Timefold identifies each setting and provides a specific managed resource, `SolverManager`.

==== Solver configuration properties

The configuration properties for multiple solvers are defined using the namespace `quarkus.timefold.solver.<solverName>`,
where `<solverName>` is the name of the related solver. The `<solverName>` property is only necessary when using multiple
solvers. For defining a single solver, refer to the xref:#integrationWithQuarkusProperties[Timefold configuration properties section].
Following properties are supported:

:property_prefix: quarkus.
:solver_name_prefix: <solverName>.
include::config-properties.adoc[]

==== Working with multiple Solvers

The different solver settings are configured in the `application.properties` file. For example, two different time
settings for `spent-limit` are defined as follows:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
# The solver "fastSolver" runs only for 5 seconds, and "regularSolver" runs for 10s
quarkus.timefold.solver."fastSolver".termination.spent-limit=5s // <1>
quarkus.timefold.solver."regularSolver".termination.spent-limit=10s // <2>
----
<1> Define a solver config named *fastSolver*.
<2> Define a solver config named *regularSolver*.

To inject a specific `SolverManager`, use the `@Named` annotation along with the solver configuration name, e.g., fastSolver.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
--
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@Path("/path")
public class Resource {

    @Named("fastSolver")
    SolverManager<...> fastSolver;

    @Named("regularSolver")
    SolverManager<...> regularSolver;

    ...
}
----
--
Kotlin::
+
--
[source,kotlin,options="nowrap"]
----
@Path("path")
class Resource {

    private final var fastSolver: SolverManager<...>?
    private final var regularSolver: SolverManager<...>?

    @Inject
    constructor(
        @Named("fastSolver") fastSolver: SolverManager<Timetable, String>,
        @Named("regularSolver") fastSolver: SolverManager<Timetable, String>
    ) {
        this.fastSolver = fastSolver
        this.regularSolver = regularSolver
    }

    ...
}

For a more advanced example, let's imagine two different steps for optimizing the school timetabling problem:

1. Initially, a specific group of teachers is designated to teach the available lessons.
2. The next step involves assigning lessons to the rooms.

To configure two different problems, add two XML files containing related planning configurations.

[tabs]
====
teachersSolverConfig.xml::
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <solutionClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.TeacherToLessonSchedule</solutionClass>
  <entityClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.Teacher</entityClass>
</solver>
----
roomsSolverConfig.xml::

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <solutionClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.Timetable</solutionClass>
  <entityClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.Lesson</entityClass>
</solver>
----
====

Set the solvers with the specific XML files in the `application.properties` file:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
quarkus.timefold.solver."teacherSolver".solver-config-xml=teachersSolverConfig.xml // <1>
quarkus.timefold.solver."roomSolver".solver-config-xml=roomsSolverConfig.xml // <2>
----
<1> Define a solver config named *teacherSolver*.
<2> Define a solver config named *roomSolver*.

Now let's inject both solvers.

[#integrationWithSpringBootMultipleResources]
=== Injecting multiple instances of `SolverManager`

Spring Boot auto-configuration module allows for defining different solver settings or even wholly distinct planning problems in the same
application. Timefold identifies each setting and provides a specific managed resource, `SolverManager`.

==== Solver configuration properties

The configuration properties for multiple solvers are defined using the namespace `timefold.solver.<solverName>`,
where `<solverName>` is the name of the related solver. The `<solverName>` property is only necessary when using multiple
solvers. For defining a single solver, refer to the xref:#integrationWithSpringBootProperties[Timefold configuration properties section].
Following properties are supported:

:property_prefix:
:solver_name_prefix: <solverName>.
include::config-properties.adoc[]

==== Working with multiple Solvers

The different solver settings are configured in the `application.properties` file. For example, two different time
settings for `spent-limit` are defined as follows:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
# The solver "fastSolver" runs only for 5 seconds, and "regularSolver" runs for 10s
timefold.solver.fastSolver.termination.spent-limit=5s // <1>
timefold.solver.regularSolver.termination.spent-limit=10s // <2>
----
<1> Define a solver config named *fastSolver*.
<2> Define a solver config named *regularSolver*.

To inject a specific `SolverManager`, use the `@Qualifier` annotation along with the solver configuration name, e.g., fastSolver.

    var regularSolver: SolverManager<...>?

For a more advanced example, let's imagine two different steps for optimizing the school timetabling problem:

1. Initially, a specific group of teachers is designated to teach the available lessons.
2. The next step involves assigning lessons to the rooms.

To configure two different problems, add two XML files containing related planning configurations.

[tabs]
====
teachersSolverConfig.xml::
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <solutionClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.TeacherToLessonSchedule</solutionClass>
  <entityClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.Teacher</entityClass>
</solver>
----
roomsSolverConfig.xml::
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <solutionClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.Timetable</solutionClass>
  <entityClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.domain.Lesson</entityClass>
</solver>
----
====

Set the solvers with the specific XML files in the `application.properties` file:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
timefold.solver.teacherSolver.solver-config-xml=teachersSolverConfig.xml // <1>
timefold.solver.roomSolver.solver-config-xml=roomsSolverConfig.xml // <2>
----
<1> Define a solver config named *teacherSolver*.
<2> Define a solver config named *roomSolver*.

Now let's inject both solvers.

[tabs]
====
Java::

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class TeacherToLessonSchedule {
    ...
}

@PlanningEntity
public class Teacher {
    ...
}

public class Resource {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("teacherSolver")
    SolverManager<TeacherToLessonSchedule, String> teacherToLessonScheduleSolverManager;

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("roomSolver")
    SolverManager<Timetable, String> lessonToRoomTimeslotSolverManager;

    ...
}

Kotlin::

    @Qualifier("teacherSolver")
    var teacherToLessonScheduleSolverManager: SolverManager<TeacherToLessonSchedule, String>?

    @Autowired

    var lessonToRoomTimeslotSolverManager: SolverManager<Timetable, String>?

    ...

**Multi-stage** planning can also be accomplished by using a separate solver configuration for each optimization stage.

[#integrationWithOtherEnvironments]
== Other environments


[#integrationWithJPMS]
=== Java platform module system (Jigsaw)

When using Timefold Solver from code on the modulepath (Java 9 and higher),
_open_ your packages that contain your domain objects, constraints and solver configuration
_to all modules_ in your `module-info.java` file:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
module org.acme.vehiclerouting {
    requires ai.timefold.solver.core;
    ...

    opens org.acme.vehiclerouting.domain; // Domain classes
    opens org.acme.vehiclerouting.solver; // Constraints
    ...
}
----

Otherwise Timefold Solver can't reach those classes or files, even if they are exported.


[#integrationWithHumanPlanners]
== Integration with human planners (politics)

A good Timefold Solver implementation beats any good human planner for non-trivial datasets.
Many human planners fail to accept this, often because they feel threatened by an automated system.

But despite that, both can benefit if the human planner becomes the supervisor of Timefold Solver:

* *The human planner defines, validates, and tweaks the score function.*
** The human planner tweaks the constraint weights of the xref:constraints-and-score/constraint-configuration.adoc[constraint configuration] in a UI,
as the business priorities change over time.
** When the business changes, the score function often needs to change too.
The human planner can notify the developers to add, change or remove score constraints.
* *The human planner is always in control of Timefold Solver.*
** The human planner can pin down one or more planning variables to a specific planning value.
Because they are xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#pinnedPlanningEntities[pinned],
Timefold Solver does not change them: it optimizes the planning around the enforcements made by the human.
If the human planner pins down all planning variables, he/she sidelines Timefold Solver completely.
** In a prototype implementation, the human planner occasionally uses pinning to intervene,
but as the implementation matures, this should become obsolete.
The feature should be kept available as a reassurance for the humans,
and in the event that the business changes dramatically before the score constraints are adjusted accordingly.

For this reason, it is recommended that the human planner is actively involved in your project.

[#sizingHardwareAndSoftware]
== Sizing hardware and software

Before sizing a Timefold Solver service, first understand the typical behaviour of a `Solver.solve()` call:

image::integration/sizingHardware.png[align="center"]

Understand these guidelines to decide the hardware for a Timefold Solver service:

* **RAM memory**: Provision plenty, but no need to provide more.
** The problem dataset, loaded before Timefold Solver is called, often consumes the most memory. It depends on the problem scale.
*** If this is a problem, review the domain class structure: remove classes or fields that Timefold Solver doesn't need during solving.
*** Timefold Solver usually has up to three solution instances: the internal working solution, the best solution and the old best solution (when it's being replaced). However, these are all a xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#cloningASolution[planning clone] of each other, so many problem fact instances are shared between those solution instances.
** During solving, the memory is very volatile, because solving creates many short-lived objects. The Garbage Collector deletes these in bulk and therefore needs some heap space as a buffer.
** The maximum size of the JVM heap space can be in three states:
*** **Insufficient**: An `OutOfMemoryException` is thrown (often because the Garbage Collector is using more than 98% of the CPU time).
*** **Narrow**: The heap buffer for those short-lived instances is too small, therefore the Garbage Collector needs to run more than it would like to, which causes a performance loss.
**** Profiling shows that in the heap chart, the used heap space frequently touches the max heap space during solving. It also shows that the Garbage Collector has a significant CPU usage impact.
**** Adding more heap space increases the xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#moveEvaluationSpeed[move evaluation speed].
*** **Plenty**: There is enough heap space. The Garbage Collector is active, but its CPU usage is low.
**** Adding more heap space does _not_ increase performance.
**** Usually, this is around 300 to 500MB above the dataset size, _regardless of the problem scale_,
except with xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#nearbySelection[nearby selection] and caching move selector,
neither of which are used by default.
* **CPU power**: More is better.
** Improving CPU speed directly increases the xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#moveEvaluationSpeed[move evaluation speed].
*** If the CPU power is twice as fast, it takes half the time to find the same result. However, this does not guarantee that it finds a better result in the same time, nor that it finds a similar result for a problem twice as big in the same time.
*** Increasing CPU power usually does not resolve scaling issues, because planning problems scale exponentially. Power tweaking the solver configuration has far better results for scaling issues than throwing hardware at it.
** During the `solve()` method, the CPU power will max out until it returns
(except in xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#daemon[daemon mode]
or if your xref:optimization-algorithms/overview.adoc#SolverEventListener[SolverEventListener] writes the best solution to disk or the network).
* **Number of CPU cores**: one CPU core per active Solver, plus at least one for the operating system.
** So in a multitenant application, which has one Solver per tenant, this means one CPU core per tenant, unless the number of solver threads is limited, as that limits the number of tenants being solved in parallel.
** With Partitioned Search, presume one CPU core per partition (per active tenant), unless the number of partition threads is limited.
*** To reduce the number of used cores, it can be better to reduce the partition threads (so solve some partitions sequentially) than to reduce the number of partitions.
** In use cases with many tenants (such as scheduling Software as a Service) or many partitions, it might not be affordable to provision that many CPUs.
*** Reduce the number of active Solvers at a time. For example: give each tenant only one minute of machine time and use a `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool to queue requests.
*** Distribute the Solver runs across the day (or night). This is especially an opportunity in SaaS that's used across the globe, due to timezones: UK and India can use the same CPU core when scheduling at night.
** The SolverManager will take care of the orchestration, especially in those underfunded environments in which solvers (and partitions) are forced to share CPU cores or wait in line.
* **I/O (network, disk, ...)**: Not used during solving.
** Timefold Solver is not a web server: a solver thread does not block (unlike a servlet thread), each one fully drains a CPU.
*** A web server can handle 24 active servlets threads with eight cores without performance loss, because most servlets threads are blocking on I/O.
*** However, 24 active solver threads with eight cores will cause each solver's xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#moveEvaluationSpeed[move evaluation speed] to be three times slower, causing a big performance loss.
** Note that calling any I/O during solving, for example a remote service in your score calculation, causes a huge performance loss because it's called thousands of times per second, so it should complete in microseconds. So no good implementation does that.

Keep these guidelines in mind when selecting and configuring the software.
See https://timefold.ai/blog/[our blog archive] for the details of our experiments, which use our diverse set of examples.
Your mileage may vary.

* Operating System
** No experimentally proven advice yet (but prefer Linux anyway).
* JDK
** Version: Our benchmarks have consistently shown improvements in performance when comparing new JDK releases with their predecessors. It is therefore recommended using the latest available JDK. If you're interested in the performance comparisons of Timefold Solver running of different JDK releases, you can find them in the form of blog posts in https://timefold.ai/blog/[our blog archive].
** Garbage Collector: ParallelGC can be potentially between 5% and 35% faster than G1GC (the default). Unlike web servers, Timefold Solver needs a GC focused on throughput, not latency. Use `-XX:+UseParallelGC` to turn on ParallelGC.
* Logging can have a severe impact on performance.
** Debug logging `ai.timefold.solver` can be between 0% and 15% slower than info logging. Trace logging can be between 5% and 70% slower than info logging.
** Synchronous logging to a file has an additional significant impact for debug and trace logging (but not for info logging).
* Avoid a cloud environment in which you share your CPU core(s) with other virtual machines or containers. Performance (and therefore solution quality) can be unreliable when the available CPU power varies greatly.

Keep in mind that the perfect hardware/software environment will probably _not_ solve scaling issues (even Moore's law is too slow).
There is no need to follow these guidelines to the letter.
