////
Quarkus and Spring Boot support the same configuration properties.
All the properties are in this file, which can then be included multiple times.
The {property_prefix} attribute is used for Quarkus properties.
The {solver_name_prefix} attribute is the solver name for multiple managers.
////

ifeval::["{solver_name_prefix}" == ""]
{property_prefix}timefold.solver-manager.parallel-solver-count::
The number of solvers that run in parallel.
This directly influences CPU consumption.
Defaults to `AUTO`.
endif::[]

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}solver-config-xml::
A classpath resource to read the xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#solverConfiguration[solver configuration XML].
Defaults to `solverConfig.xml`.
If a resource is specified, it must be located in the classpath, or the configuration will fail.
If the property is not specified, the file `solverConfig.xml` is used when found on the classpath. Otherwise, the
configuration continues without using any configuration file.
The specified resources take precedence over the default file `solverConfig.xml`, even if both files' resources are
located in the classpath.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}random-seed::
The random seed to be used in the solving process.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}environment-mode::
Enable xref:using-timefold-solver/running-the-solver.adoc#environmentMode[runtime assertions] to detect common bugs in your
implementation during development.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}constraint-stream-profiling-enabled::
Enable xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#constraintProfiling[constraint profiling] to identify the constraints taking the most time in score calculation and thus might be worth optimizing.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}daemon::
Enable xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#daemon[daemon mode].
In daemon mode, non-early termination pauses the solver instead of stopping it, until the next problem fact change arrives.
This is often useful for xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#realTimePlanning[real-time planning].
Defaults to `false`.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}move-thread-count::
Enable multi-threaded solving for a single problem, which increases CPU consumption.
Defaults to `NONE`.
Note that this is a feature of the xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc[Enterprise edition],
which is Timefold's commercial offering.
See xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#multithreadedIncrementalSolving[multithreaded incremental solving].

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}domain-access-type::
How Timefold Solver should access the domain model.
See xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#domainAccess[the domain access section] for more details.
ifeval::["{property_prefix}" == "quarkus."]
Defaults to `GIZMO`.
The other possible value is `REFLECTION`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{property_prefix}" == ""]
Defaults to `REFLECTION`.
The other possible value is `GIZMO`.
endif::[]

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}nearby-distance-meter-class::
Enable the xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#nearbySelection[Nearby Selection] quick configuration.
If the Nearby Selection distance meter class is specified,
the solver evaluates the available move selectors
and automatically enables Nearby Selection for the compatible move selectors.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.spent-limit::
How long the solver can run.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
The https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm[ISO8601 format]
is also supported, e.g., `PT30S` is 30 seconds. `PT5M` is 5 minutes. `PT2H` is 2 hours. `P1D` is 1 day.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.unimproved-spent-limit::
How long the solver can run without finding a new best solution after finding a new best solution.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
The https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm[ISO8601 format]
is also supported, e.g., `PT30S` is 30 seconds. `PT5M` is 5 minutes. `PT2H` is 2 hours. `P1D` is 1 day.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.best-score-limit::
Terminates the solver when a specific score (or better) has been reached.
For example: `0hard/-1000soft` terminates when the best score changes from `0hard/-1200soft` to `0hard/-900soft`.
Wildcards are supported to replace numbers.
For example: `0hard/*soft` to terminate when any feasible score is reached.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.diminished-returns.enabled::
If set to true, adds a termination to the local search phase that records the initial improvement after a duration, and terminates when the ratio new improvement/initial improvement is below a specified ratio.
If left unspecified, it is enabled only if any
{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.diminished-returns properties are defined.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.diminished-returns.sliding-window-duration::
Specify the best score from how long ago should the current best score be compared to.
For `30s`, the current best score is compared against the best score from 30 seconds ago to calculate the improvement.
`5m` is 5 minutes.
`2h` is 2 hours.
`1d` is 1 day.
The https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm[ISO8601 format]
is also supported, e.g., `PT30S` is 30 seconds.
`PT5M` is 5 minutes.
`PT2H` is 2 hours.
`P1D` is 1 day.
+
Default to `30s`.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.diminished-returns.minimum-improvement-ratio::
Specify the minimum ratio between the current improvement and the initial improvement.
Must be positive.
+
For example, if the {property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.diminished-returns.sliding-window-duration is "30s", the {property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.diminished-returns.minimum-improvement-ratio is 0.25, and the score improves by 100soft during the first 30 seconds of local search, then the local search phase will terminate when the difference between the current best score and the best score from 30 seconds ago is less than 25soft (= 0.25 100soft).
+
Defaults to 0.0001.

ifeval::["{solver_name_prefix}" == ""]
{property_prefix}timefold.benchmark.solver-benchmark-config-xml::
A classpath resource to read the benchmark configuration XML.
Defaults to solverBenchmarkConfig.xml.
If this property isn't specified, that solverBenchmarkConfig.xml is optional.

{property_prefix}timefold.benchmark.result-directory::
Where the benchmark results are written to. Defaults to
target/benchmarks.

{property_prefix}timefold.benchmark.solver.termination.spent-limit::
How long solver should be run in a benchmark run.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
Also supports ISO-8601 format, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html[Duration].
