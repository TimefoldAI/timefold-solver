////
Quarkus and Spring Boot support the same configuration properties.
All the properties are in this file, which can then be included multiple times.
The {property_prefix} attribute is used for Quarkus properties.
The {solver_name_prefix} attribute is the solver name for multiple managers.
////

ifeval::["{solver_name_prefix}" == ""]
{property_prefix}timefold.solver-manager.parallel-solver-count::
The number of solvers that run in parallel.
This directly influences CPU consumption.
Defaults to `AUTO`.
endif::[]

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}solver-config-xml::
A classpath resource to read the xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#solverConfiguration[solver configuration XML].
Defaults to `solverConfig.xml`.
If a resource is specified, it must be located in the classpath, or the configuration will fail.
If the property is not specified, the file `solverConfig.xml` is used when found on the classpath. Otherwise, the
configuration continues without using any configuration file.
The specified resources take precedence over the default file `solverConfig.xml`, even if both files' resources are
located in the classpath.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}environment-mode::
Enable xref:using-timefold-solver/running-the-solver.adoc#environmentMode[runtime assertions] to detect common bugs in your
implementation during development.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}daemon::
Enable xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#daemon[daemon mode].
In daemon mode, non-early termination pauses the solver instead of stopping it, until the next problem fact change arrives.
This is often useful for xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#realTimePlanning[real-time planning].
Defaults to `false`.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}move-thread-count::
Enable multi-threaded solving for a single problem, which increases CPU consumption.
Defaults to `NONE`.
Note that this is a feature of the xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc[Enterprise edition],
which is Timefold's commercial offering.
See xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#multithreadedIncrementalSolving[multithreaded incremental solving].

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}domain-access-type::
How Timefold Solver should access the domain model.
See xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#domainAccess[the domain access section] for more details.
ifeval::["{property_prefix}" == "quarkus."]
Defaults to `GIZMO`.
The other possible value is `REFLECTION`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{property_prefix}" == ""]
Defaults to `REFLECTION`.
The other possible value is `GIZMO`.
endif::[]

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}nearby-distance-meter-class::
Enable the xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#nearbySelection[Nearby Selection] quick configuration.
If the Nearby Selection distance meter class is specified,
the solver evaluates the available move selectors
and automatically enables Nearby Selection for the compatible move selectors.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.spent-limit::
How long the solver can run.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
The https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm[ISO8601 format]
is also supported, e.g., `PT30S` is 30 seconds. `PT5M` is 5 minutes. `PT2H` is 2 hours. `P1D` is 1 day.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.unimproved-spent-limit::
How long the solver can run without finding a new best solution after finding a new best solution.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
The https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm[ISO8601 format]
is also supported, e.g., `PT30S` is 30 seconds. `PT5M` is 5 minutes. `PT2H` is 2 hours. `P1D` is 1 day.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.{solver_name_prefix}termination.best-score-limit::
Terminates the solver when a specific score (or better) has been reached.
For example: `0hard/-1000soft` terminates when the best score changes from `0hard/-1200soft` to `0hard/-900soft`.
Wildcards are supported to replace numbers.
For example: `0hard/*soft` to terminate when any feasible score is reached.

ifeval::["{solver_name_prefix}" == ""]
{property_prefix}timefold.benchmark.solver-benchmark-config-xml::
A classpath resource to read the benchmark configuration XML.
Defaults to solverBenchmarkConfig.xml.
If this property isn't specified, that solverBenchmarkConfig.xml is optional.

{property_prefix}timefold.benchmark.result-directory::
Where the benchmark results are written to. Defaults to
target/benchmarks.

{property_prefix}timefold.benchmark.solver.termination.spent-limit::
How long solver should be run in a benchmark run.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
Also supports ISO-8601 format, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html[Duration].
