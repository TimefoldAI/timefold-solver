////
Quarkus and Spring Boot support the same configuration properties.
All the properties are in this file, which can then be included multiple times.
The {property_prefix} attribute is used for Quarkus properties.
////

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.solver-config-xml::
A classpath resource to read the xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#solverConfiguration[solver configuration XML].
Defaults to `solverConfig.xml`.
If a resource is specified, it must be located in the classpath, or the configuration will fail.
If the property is not specified, the file `solverConfig.xml` is used when found on the classpath. Otherwise, the
configuration continues without using any configuration file.
The specified resources take precedence over the default file `solverConfig.xml`, even if both files' resources are
located in the classpath.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.environment-mode::
Enable xref:using-timefold-solver/running-the-solver.adoc#environmentMode[runtime assertions] to detect common bugs in your
implementation during development.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.daemon::
Enable xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#daemon[daemon mode].
In daemon mode, non-early termination pauses the solver instead of stopping it, until the next problem fact change arrives.
This is often useful for xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#realTimePlanning[real-time planning].
Defaults to `false`.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.move-thread-count::
Enable multi-threaded solving for a single problem, which increases CPU consumption.
Defaults to `NONE`.
Note that this is a feature of the xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc[Enterprise edition],
which is Timefold's commercial offering.
See xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#multithreadedIncrementalSolving[multithreaded incremental solving].

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.domain-access-type::
How Timefold Solver should access the domain model.
See xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#domainAccess[the domain access section] for more details.
ifeval::["{property_prefix}" == "quarkus."]
Defaults to `GIZMO`.
The other possible value is `REFLECTION`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{property_prefix}" == ""]
Defaults to `REFLECTION`.
The other possible value is `GIZMO`.
endif::[]

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.termination.spent-limit::
How long the solver can run.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
The https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm[ISO8601 format]
is also supported, e.g., `PT30S` is 30 seconds. `PT5M` is 5 minutes. `PT2H` is 2 hours. `P1D` is 1 day.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.termination.unimproved-spent-limit::
How long the solver can run without finding a new best solution after finding a new best solution.
For example: `30s` is 30 seconds. `5m` is 5 minutes. `2h` is 2 hours. `1d` is 1 day.
The https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm[ISO8601 format]
is also supported, e.g., `PT30S` is 30 seconds. `PT5M` is 5 minutes. `PT2H` is 2 hours. `P1D` is 1 day.

{property_prefix}timefold.solver.<solverName>.termination.best-score-limit::
Terminates the solver when a specific score (or better) has been reached.
For example: `0hard/-1000soft` terminates when the best score changes from `0hard/-1200soft` to `0hard/-900soft`.
Wildcards are supported to replace numbers.
For example: `0hard/*soft` to terminate when any feasible score is reached.
