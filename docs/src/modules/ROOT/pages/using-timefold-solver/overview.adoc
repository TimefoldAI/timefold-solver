Solving a planning problem with Timefold Solver consists of the following steps:

. *Model your planning problem* as a class annotated with the ``@PlanningSolution`` annotation, for example the ``Timetable`` class.
. *Configure a ``Solver``*, for example a First Fit and Tabu Search solver for any `Timetable` instance.
. *Load a problem data set* from your data layer. That is the planning problem.
. *Solve it* with `Solver.solve(problem)` which returns the best solution found.
