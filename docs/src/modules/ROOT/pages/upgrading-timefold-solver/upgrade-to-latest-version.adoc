Timefold Solver public APIs are backwards compatible,
but users often also use internal Solver classes which are not guaranteed to stay compatible.
This upgrade recipe minimizes the pain to upgrade your code
and to take advantage of the newest features in Timefold Solver.

[#automaticUpgradeToLatestVersion]
== Automatic upgrade to the latest version

For many of the upgrade steps mentioned later,
we actually provide an upgrade tool that can automatically apply those changes to Java files.
This tool is based on OpenRewrite and can be run as a Maven or Gradle plugin.
To run the tool, execute the following command in your project directory:

[tabs]
====

Having done that, you can check the local changes and commit them.
Note that none of the upgrade steps could be automatically applied,
and it may still be worth your while to read the rest the upgrade recipe below.

For the time being, Kotlin users need to follow the upgrade recipe and apply the steps manually.

[#manualUpgrade]
== Manual upgrade recipe

Every upgrade note indicates how likely your code will be affected by that change:

- icon:magic[] *Automated*: Can be applied automatically using our <<automaticUpgradeToLatestVersion,upgrade tooling>>.
- icon:exclamation-triangle[role=red] *Major*: Likely to affect your code.
- icon:info-circle[role=yellow] *Minor*: Lesser used feature, unlikely to affect your code.
- icon:eye[] *Recommended*: Does not affect backwards compatibility, but you probably want to be aware.

The upgrade recipe often lists the changes as they apply to Java code.
We kindly ask Kotlin and Python users to translate the changes accordingly.

=== Upgrade from 1.22.0 to 1.23.0

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] `@PlanningEntity` `pinningFilter` deprecated for removal
[%collapsible%open]
====
Pinning filters are an outdated way of specifying whether or not any particular entity might be changed by the solver.
It makes more sense to keep this information in the dataset, as opposed to having it in the runtime.
We have now deprecated the `pinningFilter` field on `@PlanningEntity` annotation,
and we encourage you to use the xref:responding-to-change/responding-to-change.adoc#pinnedPlanningEntities[`@PlanningPin` annotation] instead.
====


=== Upgrade from 1.21.0 to 1.22.0

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Formalization of inheritance rules
[%collapsible%open]
====
We have streamlined and clarified the rules of inheritance when modeling planning solutions and planning entities.
The documentation now describes how to use it for both the
xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningModelSolutionInheritance[solution] and xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningModelEntiyInheritance[entity] models.

We do not expect that the clarified rules will impact existing user code,
but it is possible that some unexpected corner cases will break.
If that is the case, please let us know.
====

'''

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Init score no longer available
[%collapsible%open]
====
It is no longer possible to create a score which would have any other `init` value than zero.
The `Score.initScore()` method now returns zero in all cases.
The `Score.withInitScore(...)` method now returns the unchanged score,
making it impossible to set the init score in any way.
All such methods were deprecated and will be removed in a future major version of Timefold Solver.
Additionally, the `Score` classes no longer have the `initScore` field.

Although this is technically a backwards-incompatible change,
it only affects a small minority of users who do not allow nullable planning variables.
For everyone else, the value had always been zero.

Users which need to understand when their solutions have been initialized
can refer to the initialization event on the `SolverManager`,
or to `BestSolutionChangedEvent.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` method.
====

'''

icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Score analysis diff correctly omitting certain matches
[%collapsible%open]
====
We fixed a bug in `ScoreAnalysis.diff(...)` which would list constraint matches as different,
even in cases where there were no differences between two sets of constraint matches.
In this case, the diff would contain an otherwise empty entry for each such constraint,
leading to confusion as to its meaning.

In the new version, `ScoreAnalysis` no longer returns such constraints.
User queries for such constraints will now result in `null`,
as they should.
We expect this change will only affect a tiny number of users,
and we encourage users of `ScoreAnalysis` to check the heavily expanded and clarified Javadoc of the class
to discover the exact behavior of the functionality.
====


=== Upgrade from 1.19.0 to 1.20.0

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] New values for `EnvironmentMode`
[%collapsible%open]
====
We've made the following changes to the `EnvironmentMode` enum:

- `EnvironmentMode.REPRODUCIBLE` became `EnvironmentMode.NO_ASSERT`,
- `EnvironmentMode.FAST_ASSERT` became `EnvironmentMode.STEP_ASSERT`,
- and `EnvironmentMode.PHASE_ASSERT` was added.

`EnvironmentMode.PHASE_ASSERT` is the new default mode,
and it performs minimal assertions at the end of each phase.
To restore the original entirely unasserted behavior,
use `EnvironmentMode.NO_ASSERT`,
but we strongly recommend using the new default mode instead.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
var solverConfig = new SolverConfig()
    .withEnvironmentMode(EnvironmentMode.REPRODUCIBLE);
    ...
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
var solverConfig = new SolverConfig()
    .withEnvironmentMode(EnvironmentMode.NO_ASSERT);
    ...

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] `PhaseCommand` becomes public API
[%collapsible%open]
====
The internal `CustomPhaseCommand` interface becomes a `PhaseCommand`, part of our stable API.
It also receives a new argument, `BooleanSupplier isPhaseTerminated`.
The old interface is now deprecated for removal.

Before in `MyPhaseCommand.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyPhaseCommand implements CustomPhaseCommand {

    @Override
    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector scoreDirector) {
        ...
    }

}
----

After in `MyPhaseCommand.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyPhaseCommand implements PhaseCommand {

    @Override
    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector scoreDirector, BooleanSupplier isPhaseTerminated) {
        ...
    }

}
----

=== Upgrade from 1.18.0 to 1.19.0

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] New argument to `FirstInitializedSolutionConsumer`
[%collapsible%open]
====
The `FirstInitializedSolutionConsumer` of `SolverJob` gets an additional argument
(`boolean isTerminatedEarly`),
used to indicate that the solver terminated early and therefore the solution may not be fully initialized.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
var solverJob = solverManager.solveBuilder()
    .withFirstInitializedSolutionConsumer(solution -> {...})
    ...
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
var solverJob = solverManager.solveBuilder()
    .withFirstInitializedSolutionConsumer((solution, isTerminatedEarly) -> {...})
    ...
----
====


=== Upgrade from 1.15.0 to 1.16.0

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Undo tabu no longer supported
[%collapsible%open]
====
Configuring tabu search with an undo tabu is no longer supported.
Configuration options mentioning the undo tabu are still kept for backwards compatibility,
but they do not have any effect on the solver's behavior.

Regular tabu search continues to be supported as before without any changes to its behavior.

Before in `solverConfig.xml`:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<acceptor>
  <moveTabuSize>7</moveTabuSize>
  <undoMoveTabuSize>7</undoMoveTabuSize>
</acceptor>

'''

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Custom undo moves no longer required
[%collapsible%open]
====
Due to underlying improvements to the solver, we can now generate undo moves automatically
and no longer require the user to provide them.
If you implemented custom moves,
your implementations of undo moves will no longer be used and can be removed from your codebase.
Methods in the `Move` interface that deal with undo moves have been deprecated
and will be removed in a future major version of Timefold Solver.
====

'''

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] `ConstraintAnalysis.matchCount()` no longer throws an exception
[%collapsible%open]
====
Previously in xref:constraints-and-score/understanding-the-score.adoc[score analysis],
when there were no matches for a constraint,
`ConstraintAnalysis.matchCount()` would throw an exception instead of returning a number.
The behavior has been changed to depend on selected `ScoreAnalysisFetchPolicy`:

- With `FETCH_ALL`, constraint match analysis will be performed, constraint matches will be available,
and the method will return their precise count.
- With `FETCH_MATCH_COUNT`, constraint match analysis will still be performed
and the method will return the precise count of constraint matches.
The constraint matches themselves will not be available.
This is useful for situations
where the score analysis with a full list of matches can be expected to be too large to transmit over the wire.
- With `FETCH_SHALLOW`, constraint match analysis will not run, constraint matches will not be available
and the method will return `-1`.

====

=== Upgrade from 1.14.0 to 1.15.0

.icon:magic[] _Assignment Recommendation API_ replaces the _Recommended Fit API_
[%collapsible%open]
====
`SolutionManager.recommendFit(...)` has been renamed to `SolutionManager.recommendAssignment(...)`,
without changing its behavior.
The original method has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolutionManager<EmployeeSchedule, HardSoftScore> solutionManager = ...;
List<RecommendedFit<Employee, HardSoftScore>> recommendations =
    solutionManager.recommendFit(employeeSchedule, unassignedShift, Shift::getEmployee);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolutionManager<EmployeeSchedule, HardSoftScore> solutionManager = ...;
List<RecommendedAssignment<Employee, HardSoftScore>> recommendations =
    solutionManager.recommendAssignment(employeeSchedule, unassignedShift, Shift::getEmployee);
----
====

'''

.icon:eye[] "Score calculation speed" replaced by "Move evaluation speed"
[%collapsible%open]
====
In Timefold Solver's logging, the term "Score calculation speed" has been replaced by "Move evaluation speed".
This reflects the fact that the solver evaluates moves, and each move can result in multiple score calculations.
To avoid confusion, we have updated the logging messages to use the new term.

This change is purely cosmetic and does not affect the behavior of the solver, or your code.
====


=== Upgrade from 1.12.0 to 1.13.0

icon:exclamation-triangle[role=red] `@ConstraintConfiguration` deprecated
[%collapsible%open]
====
`@ConstraintConfiguration` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.
Please use xref:constraints-and-score/constraint-configuration.adoc#definingAndOverridingConstraintWeights[constraint weight overrides] instead.

Before in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
...
    .penalizeConfigurable()
    .asConstraint("maxHoursWorked");
...
----

After in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----

    constraintWeightOverrides = ConstraintWeightOverrides.of(
        Map.of(
            "maxHoursWorked", HardSoftScore.ofSoft(10)
        )
    );
...
----

'''

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Constraint packages have been deprecated
[%collapsible%open]
====
In the solver, constraints are uniquely identified by their package and name.
We have now deprecated the package name and we recommend to keep constraint names unique instead.

Before in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
...
    .penalize(ONE_SOFT)
    .asConstraint("employees.paris", "maxHoursWorked");
...
----

After in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
...
    .penalize(ONE_SOFT)
    .asConstraint("employees.paris.maxHoursWorked");
...
----

While constraint packages are still supported, they will be removed in a future major version.
====

'''

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] `ConstraintCollectors.toMap()` now respects the optional merge function
[%collapsible%open]
====
In your constraints, the following code may now behave differently:

[source,java]
----
...
return constraintFactory.forEach(Entity.class)
    .groupBy(
        ConstraintCollectors.toMap(
            entity -> entity.name(),
            entity -> entity.id(),
            (entityId1, entityId2) -> Math.max(entityId1, entityId2)
        )
    )
...
----

The final argument to the mapping collector is now respected,
where previously it was wrongly ignored under certain conditions.
This may result in the map being populated differently than before.
====

=== Upgrade from 1.9.0 to 1.10.0

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Pinning unassigned entities now fails fast, unless allowed
[%collapsible%open]
====
The solver behavior has changed in the following situation:

1. There is a planning entity with a `@PlanningVariable` that does not allow unassigned values.
2. And that planning entity is pinned.
3. And that variable is set to `null`, therefore unassigned.

This situation is both unlikely and erroneous.
The solver is asked to require all variables to be assigned, but at the same time one variable is forced unassigned.

Before Timefold Solver 1.10.0, this would result in Construction Heuristics finishing with a negative `init` score.
Starting with Timefold Solver 1.10.0, this situation will result in a runtime exception.

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] `LookupStrategyType` deprecated for removal
[%collapsible%open]
====
`LookupStrategyType` is used in xref:enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition.adoc#multithreadedIncrementalSolving[multi-threaded incremental solving]
to specify how the solver should match entities and facts between parent and child score directors.
The default value is `PLANNING_ID_OR_NONE`, which means
that the solver will look up entities by their xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningId[planning ID].
If the solver doesn't find anything with that ID, it will throw an exception.

In a future version of _Timefold Solver_, we will remove the option of configuring the lookup strategy.
The behavior will be fixed to the behavior explained above.
To prepare for this change,
remove the use of `@PlanningSolution.lookupStrategyType`
and ensure that your planning entities and problem facts have a `@PlanningId`-annotated field.

Before in `Timetable.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution(lookUpStrategyType = LookUpStrategyType.PLANNING_ID_OR_NONE)
public class Timetable {
    ...
}

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Removed the `examples` module
[%collapsible%open]
====
We have finished the process of removing the Swing-based examples.
The legacy examples from the solver codebase have been removed entirely.

You can find better, more modern implementations of these use cases in our quickstarts, including:

- `bed-allocation`,
- `conference-scheduling`,
- `employee-scheduling`,
- `facility-location`,
- `flight-crew-scheduling`,
- `food-packaging`,
- `maintenance-scheduling`,
- `meeting-scheduling`,
- `order-picking`,
- `project-job-scheduling`,
- `school-timetabling`,

- `task-assigning`,
- `tournament-scheduling`,
- and `vehicle-routing`.

We have simplified and renamed all quickstarts `artifactId` names.
For example, the old artifact name `timefold-solver-quarkus-vehicle-routing-quickstart` became `vehicle-routing`.

=== Upgrade from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Removed several of the old examples
[%collapsible%open]
====
We have started the process of removing the ancient Swing-based examples.
In the first wave, we have removed the following examples from the `examples` module:

- `cloudbalancing`,
- `conferencescheduling`,
- `curriculumcourse`,
- `examination`,
- `flightcrewscheduling`,
- `machinereassignment`,
- `meetingscheduling`,
- `nqueens`,
- `pas`,
- `tsp`,
- and `vehiclerouting`.

You can find better, more modern implementations of these use cases in our quickstarts.
The other examples on the list were removed without a replacement as we didn't see sufficient traction.

Going forward, our intention is to convert every other current example into a quickstart
and remove the original Swing-based examples from the solver codebase entirely.

.icon:info-circle[role=yellow] Several internal modules folded into `timefold-solver-core`
[%collapsible%open]
====
The following JAR files have been merged into `timefold-solver-core`:

- `timefold-solver-core-impl`,
- `timefold-solver-constraint-streams`.

`timefold-solver-core` was previously an empty module that served as an aggregator for the above modules.
Now it contains the source code for both modules directly.
The automatic module name for this module is `ai.timefold.solver.core`.

The root package of Constraint Streams implementation classes has changed.
If you have any custom code that references these classes,
you will need to update the imports to point `ai.timefold.solver.core.impl.score.stream.bavet`.

Finally, with the folding of these modules into `timefold-solver-core`,
the solver no longer relies on `ServiceLoader`s to find implementations of Constraint Streams,
or to find the Enterprise Edition.

None of these changes are likely to affect you, unless you have chosen to depend on internal classes and modules.

=== Upgrade from 1.7.0 to 1.8.0

.icon:exclamation-triangle[role=red] Constraint Verifier: Check your tests if you use the planning list variable
[%collapsible%open]
====
In some cases, especially if you've reused our https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts/tree/stable/java/food-packaging[Food Packaging quickstart], you may see your tests failing after the upgrade.
This is due to a bug fix in xref:constraints-and-score/score-calculation.adoc#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams], which now currently handles values not present in any list variable.

If your code has a shadow entity whose xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#listVariableShadowVariablesInverseRelation[inverse relation shadow variable] is a planning list variable and your test leaves that reference `null`, the constraints will no longer take that shadow entity into account.
This will result in `ConstraintVerifier` failing the test, as the expected number of penalties/rewards will no longer match the actual number.

You can solve this problem by manually assigning a value to the inverse relation shadow variable.

Before in `*ConstraintProviderTest.java`:

[source,java]
----
Job job = new Job("job1", ...);

constraintVerifier.verifyThat(FoodPackagingConstraintProvider::maxEndDateTime)
    .given(job)
    .penalizesBy(...);
----

After in `*ConstraintProviderTest.java`:

[source,java]
----
Job job = new Job("job1",  ...);
Line line = new Line("line1", ...);
job.setLine(line);

constraintVerifier.verifyThat(FoodPackagingConstraintProvider::maxEndDateTime)
    .given(job)
    .penalizesBy(...);
----

The aforementioned quickstart unfortunately did not follow our own guidance on the use of shadow variables, which is why it exposed this bug.
