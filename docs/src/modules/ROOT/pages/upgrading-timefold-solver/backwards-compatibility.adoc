[#backwardsCompatibility]
= Backwards compatibility
:doctype: book
:icons: font

Timefold Solver separates its API from its implementation:

* **Public API**: All classes under these `api` and `config` namespaces are 100% *backwards compatible* in future minor and hotfix releases:
** `ai.timefold.solver.core.api`
** `ai.timefold.solver.benchmark.api`
** `ai.timefold.solver.test.api`
** `ai.timefold.solver.*.api`
** `ai.timefold.solver.core.config`
** `ai.timefold.solver.benchmark.config`
* **Implementation classes**: All other classes are _not_ backwards compatible.
They will change in future major or minor releases,
but probably not in hotfix releases.

Backwards incompatible changes for a new major version are clearly documented in xref:upgrading-timefold-solver/upgrade-to-latest-version.adoc#manualUpgrade[the upgrade recipe].

[#previewFeatures]
== Preview features

Timefold Solver includes several components which are only available as preview features.
These are in `preview.api` packages.
These are:

- xref:optimization-algorithms/local-search.adoc#diversifiedLateAcceptance[Diversified Late Acceptance] acceptor
- xref:constraints-and-score/understanding-the-score.adoc#solutionDiff[Solution diff API]
in the `ai.timefold.solver.core.preview.api.domain.solution.diff` package,
and in the `SolutionManager`
- _Timefold Solver for Python_, which is currently in beta

These preview features are developed to the same standard as the rest of Timefold Solver.
However, their APIs are not yet considered stable, pending user feedback.
Any class, method or field related to these features may change or be removed without prior notice,
although we strive to avoid this as much as possible.

We encourage you to try these preview features and give us feedback on your experience with them.
Please direct your feedback to
https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver/discussions[Timefold Solver Github].

=== Experimental status of Move Streams

Move Streams, although marked as a preview feature, is an active research project.
It is intended to simplify the creation of custom moves, eventually replacing move selectors.
The component is under heavy development, entirely undocumented, and many key features are yet to be delivered.
Neither the API nor the feature set are complete, and any part can change or be removed at any time.

Move Streams will eventually stabilize and be promoted from a research project to a true preview feature.
We only expose it now to be able to use it for experimentation and testing.
As such, it is an exception to the rule â€” this preview feature is not finished, and it is not yet ready for feedback.
