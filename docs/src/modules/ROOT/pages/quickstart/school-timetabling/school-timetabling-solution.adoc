= Gather the domain objects in a planning solution
:imagesdir: ../..

A `Timetable` wraps all `Timeslot`, `Room`, and `Lesson` instances of a single dataset.
Furthermore, because it contains all lessons, each with a specific planning variable state,
it is a _planning solution_ and it has a score:

* If lessons are still unassigned, then it is an _uninitialized_ solution,
for example, a solution with the score `-4init/0hard/0soft`.
* If it breaks hard constraints, then it is an _infeasible_ solution,
for example, a solution with the score `-2hard/-3soft`.
* If it adheres to all hard constraints, then it is a _feasible_ solution,
for example, a solution with the score `0hard/-7soft`.

The `Timetable` class has an `@PlanningSolution` annotation,
so Timefold Solver knows that this class contains all of the input and output data.

Specifically, these classes are the input of the problem:

* The `timeslots` field with all time slots
** This is a list of problem facts, because they do not change during solving.
* The `rooms` field with all rooms
** This is a list of problem facts, because they do not change during solving.
* The `lessons` field with all lessons
** This is a list of planning entities, because they change during solving.
** Of each `Lesson`:
*** The values of the `timeslot` and `room` fields are typically still `null`, so unassigned.
They are planning variables.
*** The other fields, such as `subject`, `teacher` and `studentGroup`, are filled in.
These fields are problem properties.

However, this class is also the output of the solution:

* The `lessons` field for which each `Lesson` instance has non-null `timeslot` and `room` fields after solving.
* The `score` field that represents the quality of the output solution, for example, `0hard/-5soft`.

== The value range providers

The `timeslots` field is a value range provider.
It holds the `Timeslot` instances which Timefold Solver can pick from to assign to the `timeslot` field of `Lesson` instances.
The `timeslots` field has an `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation to connect the `@PlanningVariable` with the `@ValueRangeProvider`,
by matching the type of the planning variable with the type returned by the xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningValueRangeProvider[value range provider].

Following the same logic, the `rooms` field also has an `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation.

== The problem fact and planning entity properties

Furthermore, Timefold Solver needs to know which `Lesson` instances it can change
as well as how to retrieve the `Timeslot` and `Room` instances used for score calculation
by your `TimetableConstraintProvider`.

The `timeslots` and `rooms` fields have an `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation,
so your `TimetableConstraintProvider` can select _from_ those instances.

The `lessons` has an `@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty` annotation,
so Timefold Solver can change them during solving
and your `TimetableConstraintProvider` can select _from_ those too.
