=== Try the application

Now that the application is running, you can test the REST service.
You can use any REST client you wish.
The following example uses the Linux command `curl` to send a POST request:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/timetables -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"timeslots":[{"dayOfWeek":"MONDAY","startTime":"08:30:00","endTime":"09:30:00"},{"dayOfWeek":"MONDAY","startTime":"09:30:00","endTime":"10:30:00"}],"rooms":[{"name":"Room A"},{"name":"Room B"}],"lessons":[{"id":1,"subject":"Math","teacher":"A. Turing","studentGroup":"9th grade"},{"id":2,"subject":"Chemistry","teacher":"M. Curie","studentGroup":"9th grade"},{"id":3,"subject":"French","teacher":"M. Curie","studentGroup":"10th grade"},{"id":4,"subject":"History","teacher":"I. Jones","studentGroup":"10th grade"}]}'
----

After about five seconds, according to the termination spent time defined in your `application.properties`,
the service returns an output similar to the following example:

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
...

{"timeslots":...,"rooms":...,"lessons":[{"id":1,"subject":"Math","teacher":"A. Turing","studentGroup":"9th grade","timeslot":{"dayOfWeek":"MONDAY","startTime":"08:30:00","endTime":"09:30:00"},"room":{"name":"Room A"}},{"id":2,"subject":"Chemistry","teacher":"M. Curie","studentGroup":"9th grade","timeslot":{"dayOfWeek":"MONDAY","startTime":"09:30:00","endTime":"10:30:00"},"room":{"name":"Room A"}},{"id":3,"subject":"French","teacher":"M. Curie","studentGroup":"10th grade","timeslot":{"dayOfWeek":"MONDAY","startTime":"08:30:00","endTime":"09:30:00"},"room":{"name":"Room B"}},{"id":4,"subject":"History","teacher":"I. Jones","studentGroup":"10th grade","timeslot":{"dayOfWeek":"MONDAY","startTime":"09:30:00","endTime":"10:30:00"},"room":{"name":"Room B"}}],"score":"0hard/0soft"}
----

Notice that your application assigned all four lessons to one of the two time slots and one of the two rooms.
Also notice that it conforms to all hard constraints.
For example, M. Curie's two lessons are in different time slots.

On the server side, the `info` log shows what Timefold Solver did in those five seconds:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
... Solving started: time spent (33), best score (0hard/0soft), environment mode (PHASE_ASSERT), random (JDK with seed 0).
... Construction Heuristic phase (0) ended: time spent (73), best score (0hard/0soft), move evaluation speed (459/sec), step total (4).
