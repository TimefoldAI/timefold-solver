[#enterpriseEditionFeatures]
== Features of Enterprise Edition

The following features are only available in Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition:

* <<nearbySelection,Nearby selection>>,
* <<multithreadedSolving,multi-threaded solving>>,
* and <<partitionedSearch,partitioned Search>>.


[#nearbySelection]
=== Nearby selection

[NOTE]
====
This feature is a commercial feature of Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition.
It is not available in the Community Edition.
====

In some use cases (such as TSP and VRP, but also in non-chained variable cases),
changing entities to nearby values or swapping nearby entities can *heavily increase scalability* and improve solution quality.

image::enterprise-edition/nearbySelectionMotivation.png[align="center"]

Nearby selection increases the probability of selecting an entity or value which is nearby to the first entity being moved in that move.

image::enterprise-edition/nearbySelectionRandomDistribution.png[align="center"]

The distance between two entities or values is domain specific.
Therefore, implement the `NearbyDistanceMeter` interface:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface NearbyDistanceMeter<Origin_, Desination_> {

    double getNearbyDistance(Origin_ origin, Destination_ destination);

}
----
In a nutshell, when nearby selection is used in a list move selector,
`Origin_` is always a planning value (for example `Customer`)
but `Destination_` can be either a planning value or a planning entity.
That means that in VRP the distance meter must be able to handle both `Customer` and `Vehicle` as the `Destination_` argument:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class CustomerNearbyDistanceMeter implements NearbyDistanceMeter<Customer, LocationAware> {

    public double getNearbyDistance(Customer origin, LocationAware destination) {
        return origin.getDistanceTo(destination);
    }

}
----

[NOTE]
====
`NearbyDistanceMeter` implementations are expected to be stateless.
The solver may choose to reuse them in different contexts.
====

==== Nearby selection with a list variable

To configure nearby selection with a planning list variable,
add a `nearbySelection` element in the `destinationSelector`,`valueSelector` or `subListSelector`
and use xref:optimization-algorithms/optimization-algorithms.adoc#mimicSelection[mimic selection] to specify which destination, value, or subList should be near by the selection.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]

----

==== Nearby selection with a chained variable

To configure nearby selection with a chained planning variable, add a `nearbySelection` element in the `entitySelector` or `valueSelector`
and use <<mimicSelection,mimic selection>> to specify which entity should be near by the selection.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <unionMoveSelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector id="entitySelector1"/>
        <valueSelector>

      <swapMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector id="entitySelector2"/>
        <secondaryEntitySelector>
          <nearbySelection>
            <originEntitySelector mimicSelectorRef="entitySelector2"/>
            <nearbyDistanceMeterClass>...CustomerNearbyDistanceMeter</nearbyDistanceMeterClass>
            <parabolicDistributionSizeMaximum>40</parabolicDistributionSizeMaximum>
          </nearbySelection>
        </secondaryEntitySelector>
      </swapMoveSelector>
      <tailChainSwapMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector id="entitySelector3"/>
        <valueSelector>
          <nearbySelection>
            <originEntitySelector mimicSelectorRef="entitySelector3"/>
            <nearbyDistanceMeterClass>...CustomerNearbyDistanceMeter</nearbyDistanceMeterClass>
            <parabolicDistributionSizeMaximum>40</parabolicDistributionSizeMaximum>
          </nearbySelection>
        </valueSelector>
      </tailChainSwapMoveSelector>
    </unionMoveSelector>
----

A `distributionSizeMaximum` parameter should not be 1 because if the nearest is already the planning value of the current entity, then the only move that is selectable is not doable.

To allow every element to be selected, regardless of the number of entities, only set the distribution type (so without a `distributionSizeMaximum` parameter):

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <nearbySelection>
    <nearbySelectionDistributionType>PARABOLIC_DISTRIBUTION</nearbySelectionDistributionType>
  </nearbySelection>
----

The following ``NearbySelectionDistributionType``s are supported:

* ``BLOCK_DISTRIBUTION``: Only the n nearest are selected, with an equal probability. For example, select the 20 nearest:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <nearbySelection>
    <blockDistributionSizeMaximum>20</blockDistributionSizeMaximum>
  </nearbySelection>
----
* ``LINEAR_DISTRIBUTION``: Nearest elements are selected with a higher probability. The probability decreases linearly.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <nearbySelection>
    <linearDistributionSizeMaximum>40</linearDistributionSizeMaximum>
  </nearbySelection>
----
* `PARABOLIC_DISTRIBUTION` (recommended): Nearest elements are selected with a higher probability.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <nearbySelection>
    <parabolicDistributionSizeMaximum>80</parabolicDistributionSizeMaximum>
  </nearbySelection>
----
* ``BETA_DISTRIBUTION``: Selection according to a beta distribution. Slows down the solver significantly.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <nearbySelection>
    <betaDistributionAlpha>1</betaDistributionAlpha>
    <betaDistributionBeta>5</betaDistributionBeta>
  </nearbySelection>
----

As always, use the xref:benchmarking-and-tweaking/benchmarking-and-tweaking.adoc#benchmarker[Benchmarker] to tweak values if desired.


[#multithreadedSolving]
=== Multi-threaded solving

[NOTE]
====
This feature is a commercial feature of Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition.
It is not available in the Community Edition.
====

There are several ways of doing multi-threaded solving:

* *Multitenancy*: solve different datasets in parallel
** The `SolverManager` will make it even easier to set this up, in a future version.
* *Multi bet solving*: solve 1 dataset with multiple, isolated solvers and take the best result.
** Not recommended: This is a marginal gain for a high cost of hardware resources.
** Use the xref:benchmarking-and-tweaking/benchmarking-and-tweaking.adoc#benchmarker[Benchmarker] during development to determine the most appropriate algorithm, although that's only on average.
** Use multi-threaded incremental solving instead.
* *Partitioned Search*: Split 1 dataset in multiple parts and solve them independently.
** Configure a <<partitionedSearch,Partitioned Search>>.
* *Multi-threaded incremental solving*: solve 1 dataset with multiple threads without sacrificing xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#incrementalScoreCalculation[incremental score calculation].
** Donate a portion of your CPU cores to Timefold Solver to scale up the score calculation speed and get the same results in fraction of the time.
** Configure <<multithreadedIncrementalSolving,multi-threaded incremental solving>>.

image::enterprise-edition/multiThreadingStrategies.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
A xref:configuration/configuration.adoc#logging[logging level] of `debug` or `trace` might cause congestion multi-threaded solving
and slow down the xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#scoreCalculationSpeed[score calculation speed].
====

[#planningId]
==== `@PlanningId`

For some functionality (such as multi-threaded solving and real-time planning),
Timefold Solver needs to map problem facts and planning entities to an ID.
Timefold Solver uses that ID to _rebase_ a move from one thread's solution state to another's.

To enable such functionality, specify the `@PlanningId` annotation on the identification field or getter method,
for example on the database ID:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class CloudComputer {

    @PlanningId
    private Long id;

    ...
}
----

Or alternatively, on another type of ID:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class User {

    @PlanningId
    private String username;

    ...
}
----

A `@PlanningId` property must be:

* Unique for that specific class
** It does not need to be unique across different problem fact classes
(unless in that rare case that those classes are mixed in the same value range or planning entity collection).
* An instance of a type that implements `Object.hashCode()` and `Object.equals()`.
** It's recommended to use the type `Integer`, `int`, `Long`, `long`, `String` or `UUID`.
* Never `null` by the time `Solver.solve()` is called.


[#customThreadFactory]
==== Custom thread factory (WildFly, GAE, ...)

The `threadFactoryClass` allows to plug in a custom `ThreadFactory` for environments
where arbitrary thread creation should be avoided,
such as most application servers (including WildFly) or Google App Engine.

Configure the `ThreadFactory` on the solver to create the <<multithreadedIncrementalSolving,move threads>>
and the <<partitionedSearch,Partition Search threads>> with it:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
  ...
</solver>
----

[#multithreadedIncrementalSolving]
==== Multi-threaded incremental solving

Enable multi-threaded incremental solving by <<planningId,adding a @PlanningId annotation>>
on every planning entity class and planning value class.
Then configure a `moveThreadCount`:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <moveThreadCount>AUTO</moveThreadCount>
  ...
</solver>
----

That one extra line heavily improves the score calculation speed,
presuming that your machine has enough free CPU cores.

Advanced configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <moveThreadCount>4</moveThreadCount>
  <moveThreadBufferSize>10</moveThreadBufferSize>
  <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
  ...
</solver>
----

A `moveThreadCount` of `4` xref:integration/integration.adoc#sizingHardwareAndSoftware[saturates almost 5 CPU cores]:
the 4 move threads fill up 4 CPU cores completely
and the solver thread uses most of another CPU core.

The following ``moveThreadCount``s are supported:

* `NONE` (default): Don't run any move threads. Use the single threaded code.
* ``AUTO``: Let Timefold Solver decide how many move threads to run in parallel.
On machines or containers with little or no CPUs, this falls back to the single threaded code.
* Static number: The number of move threads to run in parallel.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<moveThreadCount>4</moveThreadCount>
----
+
This can be `1` to enforce running the multi-threaded code with only 1 move thread
(which is less efficient than `NONE`).

It is counter-effective to set a `moveThreadCount`
that is higher than the number of available CPU cores,
as that will slow down the score calculation speed.
One good reason to do it anyway, is to reproduce a bug of a high-end production machine.

[NOTE]
====
Multi-threaded solving is _still reproducible_, as long as the resolved `moveThreadCount` is stable.
A run of the same solver configuration on 2 machines with a different number of CPUs,
is still reproducible, unless the `moveThreadCount` is set to `AUTO` or a function of `availableProcessorCount`.
====

The `moveThreadBufferSize` power tweaks the number of moves that are selected but won't be foraged.
Setting it too low reduces performance, but setting it too high too.
Unless you're deeply familiar with the inner workings of multi-threaded solving, don't configure this parameter.

To run in an environment that doesn't like arbitrary thread creation,
use `threadFactoryClass` to plug in a <<customThreadFactory,custom thread factory>>.


[#partitionedSearch]
=== Partitioned search

[NOTE]
====
This feature is a commercial feature of Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition.
It is not available in the Community Edition.
====

[#partitionedSearchAlgorithm]
==== Algorithm description

It is often more efficient to partition large data sets (usually above 5000 planning entities)
into smaller pieces and solve them separately.
Partition Search is <<multithreadedSolving,multi-threaded>>,
so it provides a performance boost on multi-core machines due to higher CPU utilization.
Additionally, even when only using one CPU, it finds an initial solution faster,
because the search space sum of a partitioned Construction Heuristic is far less than its non-partitioned variant.

However, **partitioning does lead to suboptimal results**, even if the pieces are solved optimally, as shown below:

image::enterprise-edition/mapReduceIsTerribleForTsp.png[align="center"]

It effectively trades a short term gain in solution quality for long term loss.
One way to compensate for this loss,
is to run a non-partitioned Local Search after the Partitioned Search phase.

[NOTE]
====
Not all use cases can be partitioned.
Partitioning only works for use cases where the planning entities and value ranges can be split into n partitions,
without any of the constraints crossing boundaries between partitions.
====


[#partitionedSearchConfiguration]
==== Configuration

Simplest configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <partitionedSearch>
    <solutionPartitionerClass>ai.timefold.solver.examples.cloudbalancing.optional.partitioner.CloudBalancePartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  </partitionedSearch>
----

Also <<planningId,add a @PlanningId annotations>> on every planning entity class and planning value class.
There are several ways to <<partitioningASolution,partition a solution>>.

Advanced configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <partitionedSearch>
    ...
    <solutionPartitionerClass>ai.timefold.solver.examples.cloudbalancing.optional.partitioner.CloudBalancePartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
    <runnablePartThreadLimit>4</runnablePartThreadLimit>

    <constructionHeuristic>...</constructionHeuristic>
    <localSearch>...</localSearch>
  </partitionedSearch>
----

The `runnablePartThreadLimit` allows limiting CPU usage to avoid hanging your machine, see below.

To run in an environment that doesn't like arbitrary thread creation,
plug in a <<customThreadFactory,custom thread factory>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A xref:configuration/configuration.adoc#logging[logging level] of `debug` or `trace` causes congestion in multi-threaded Partitioned Search
and slows down the xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#scoreCalculationSpeed[score calculation speed].
====

Just like a `<solver>` element, the `<partitionedSearch>` element can contain one or more xref:optimization-algorithms/optimization-algorithms.adoc#solverPhase[phases].
Each of those phases will be run on each partition.

A common configuration is to first run a Partitioned Search phase
(which includes a Construction Heuristic and a Local Search)
followed by a non-partitioned Local Search phase:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <partitionedSearch>
    <solutionPartitionerClass>...CloudBalancePartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>

    <constructionHeuristic/>
    <localSearch>
      <termination>
        <secondsSpentLimit>60</secondsSpentLimit>
      </termination>
    </localSearch>
  </partitionedSearch>
  <localSearch/>
----


[#partitioningASolution]
==== Partitioning a solution


[#customSolutionPartitioner]
===== Custom `SolutionPartitioner`

To use a custom `SolutionPartitioner`, configure one on the Partitioned Search phase:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <partitionedSearch>
    <solutionPartitionerClass>ai.timefold.solver.examples.cloudbalancing.optional.partitioner.CloudBalancePartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  </partitionedSearch>
----

Implement the `SolutionPartitioner` interface:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface SolutionPartitioner<Solution_> {

    List<Solution_> splitWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<Solution_> scoreDirector, Integer runnablePartThreadLimit);

}
----

The `size()` of the returned `List` is the `partCount` (the number of partitions).
This can be decided dynamically, for example, based on the size of the non-partitioned solution.
The `partCount` is unrelated to the `runnablePartThreadLimit`.

For example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class CloudBalancePartitioner implements SolutionPartitioner<CloudBalance> {

    private int partCount = 4;
    private int minimumProcessListSize = 75;

    @Override
    public List<CloudBalance> splitWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<CloudBalance> scoreDirector, Integer runnablePartThreadLimit) {
        CloudBalance originalSolution = scoreDirector.getWorkingSolution();
        List<CloudComputer> originalComputerList = originalSolution.getComputerList();
        List<CloudProcess> originalProcessList = originalSolution.getProcessList();
        int partCount = this.partCount;
        if (originalProcessList.size() / partCount < minimumProcessListSize) {
            partCount = originalProcessList.size() / minimumProcessListSize;
        }
        List<CloudBalance> partList = new ArrayList<>(partCount);
        for (int i = 0; i < partCount; i++) {
            CloudBalance partSolution = new CloudBalance(originalSolution.getId(),
                    new ArrayList<>(originalComputerList.size() / partCount + 1),
                    new ArrayList<>(originalProcessList.size() / partCount + 1));
            partList.add(partSolution);
        }

        int partIndex = 0;
        Map<Long, Pair<Integer, CloudComputer>> idToPartIndexAndComputerMap = new HashMap<>(originalComputerList.size());
        for (CloudComputer originalComputer : originalComputerList) {
            CloudBalance part = partList.get(partIndex);
            CloudComputer computer = new CloudComputer(
                    originalComputer.getId(),
                    originalComputer.getCpuPower(), originalComputer.getMemory(),
                    originalComputer.getNetworkBandwidth(), originalComputer.getCost());
            part.getComputerList().add(computer);
            idToPartIndexAndComputerMap.put(computer.getId(), Pair.of(partIndex, computer));
            partIndex = (partIndex + 1) % partList.size();
        }

        partIndex = 0;
        for (CloudProcess originalProcess : originalProcessList) {
            CloudBalance part = partList.get(partIndex);
            CloudProcess process = new CloudProcess(
                    originalProcess.getId(),
                    originalProcess.getRequiredCpuPower(), originalProcess.getRequiredMemory(),
                    originalProcess.getRequiredNetworkBandwidth());
            part.getProcessList().add(process);
            if (originalProcess.getComputer() != null) {
                Pair<Integer, CloudComputer> partIndexAndComputer = idToPartIndexAndComputerMap.get(
                        originalProcess.getComputer().getId());
                if (partIndexAndComputer == null) {
                    throw new IllegalStateException("The initialized process (" + originalProcess
                            + ") has a computer (" + originalProcess.getComputer()
                            + ") which doesn't exist in the originalSolution (" + originalSolution + ").");
                }
                if (partIndex != partIndexAndComputer.getLeft().intValue()) {
                    throw new IllegalStateException("The initialized process (" + originalProcess
                            + ") with partIndex (" + partIndex
                            + ") has a computer (" + originalProcess.getComputer()
                            + ") which belongs to another partIndex (" + partIndexAndComputer.getLeft() + ").");
                }
                process.setComputer(partIndexAndComputer.getRight());
            }
            partIndex = (partIndex + 1) % partList.size();
        }
        return partList;
    }

}
----

To configure values of a `SolutionPartitioner` dynamically in the solver configuration
(so the xref:benchmarking-and-tweaking/benchmarking-and-tweaking.adoc#benchmarker[Benchmarker] can tweak those parameters),
add the `solutionPartitionerCustomProperties` element and use xref:configuration/configuration.adoc#customPropertiesConfiguration[custom properties]:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <partitionedSearch>
    <solutionPartitionerClass>...CloudBalancePartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
    <solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
      <property name="myPartCount" value="8"/>
      <property name="myMinimumProcessListSize" value="100"/>
    </solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
  </partitionedSearch>
----


[#runnablePartThreadLimit]
==== Runnable part thread limit

When running a multi-threaded solver, such as Partitioned Search, CPU power can quickly become a scarce resource,
which can cause other processes or threads to hang or freeze.
However, Timefold Solver has a system to prevent CPU starving of
other processes (such as an SSH connection in production or your IDE in development)
or other threads (such as the servlet threads that handle REST requests).

As explained in xref:integration/integration.adoc#sizingHardwareAndSoftware[sizing hardware and software],
each solver (including each child solver) does no IO during `solve()` and therefore saturates one CPU core completely.
In Partitioned Search, every partition always has its own thread, called a part thread.
It is impossible for two partitions to share a thread,
because of xref:optimization-algorithms/optimization-algorithms.adoc#asynchronousTermination[asynchronous termination]:
the second thread would never run.
Every part thread will try to consume one CPU core entirely, so if there are more partitions than CPU cores,
this will probably hang the system.
`Thread.setPriority()` is often too weak to solve this hogging problem, so another approach is used.

The `runnablePartThreadLimit` parameter specifies how many part threads are runnable at the same time.
The other part threads will temporarily block and therefore will not consume any CPU power.
*This parameter basically specifies how many CPU cores are donated to Timefold Solver.*
All part threads share the CPU cores in a round-robin manner
to consume (more or less) the same number of CPU cycles:

The following `runnablePartThreadLimit` options are supported:

* `UNLIMITED`: Allow Timefold Solver to occupy all CPU cores, do not avoid hogging.
Useful if a no hogging CPU policy is configured on the OS level.
* `AUTO` (default): Let Timefold Solver decide how many CPU cores to occupy. This formula is based on experience.
It does not hog all CPU cores on a multi-core machine.
* Static number: The number of CPU cores to consume. For example:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<runnablePartThreadLimit>2</runnablePartThreadLimit>
----

[WARNING]
====
If the `runnablePartThreadLimit` is equal to or higher than the number of available processors,
the host is likely to hang or freeze,
unless there is an OS specific policy in place to avoid Timefold Solver from hogging all the CPU processors.
