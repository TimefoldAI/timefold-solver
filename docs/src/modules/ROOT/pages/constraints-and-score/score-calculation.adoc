Using Java's Streams API,
we could implement an xref:constraints-and-score/score-calculation.adoc#easyJavaScoreCalculation[easy score calculator]
that uses a functional approach:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private int doNotAssignAnn() {
        int softScore = 0;
        schedule.getShifts().stream()
                .filter(Shift::isEmployeeAnn)
                .forEach(shift -> {
                    softScore -= 1;
                });
        return softScore;
    }
----

However, that scales poorly because it doesn't do an xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#incrementalScoreCalculation[incremental calculation]:
When the planning variable of a single `Shift` changes, to recalculate the score,
the normal Streams API has to execute the entire stream from scratch.

[#constraintStreams]
== Introducing Constraint Streams

Constraint streams are a Functional Programming form of incremental score calculation in plain Java
that is easy to read, write and debug.
The API should feel familiar if you're familiar with Java Streams or SQL.

The Constraint Streams API enables you to write similar code in pure Java,
while reaping the performance benefits of incremental score calculation.
This is an example of the same code we've shown above,
only using the Constraint Streams API:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class)
                .filter(Shift::isEmployeeAnn)
                .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT)
                .asConstraint("Don't assign Ann");
    }
----

This constraint stream iterates over all instances of class `Shift` in the xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#problemFacts[problem facts] and
xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningEntity[planning entities]
in the xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningProblemAndPlanningSolution[planning problem].
It finds every `Shift` which is assigned to employee `Ann` and for every such instance (also called a match), it adds a
soft penalty of `1` to the overall xref:constraints-and-score/overview.adoc#calculateTheScore[score].
The following figure illustrates this process on a problem with 4 different shifts:

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamIntroduction.png[align="center"]

If any of the instances change during solving, the constraint stream automatically detects the change
and only recalculates the minimum necessary portion of the problem that is affected by the change.
The following figure illustrates this xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#incrementalScoreCalculation[incremental score calculation]:

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamIncrementalCalculation.png[align="center"]

Constraint Streams API also has advanced support for xref:constraints-and-score/understanding-the-score.adoc[score explanation]
through xref:constraintStreamsCustomizingJustificationsAndIndictments[custom justifications and indictments].

[#constraintStreamsConfiguration]
== Creating a constraint stream

To use the Constraint Streams API in your project, first write a pure Java `ConstraintProvider` implementation similar
to the following example.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    public class MyConstraintProvider implements ConstraintProvider {

        @Override
        public Constraint[] defineConstraints(ConstraintFactory factory) {
            return new Constraint[] {
                    penalizeEveryShift(factory)
            };
        }

        private Constraint penalizeEveryShift(ConstraintFactory factory) {
            return factory.forEach(Shift.class)
                .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT)
                .asConstraint("Penalize a shift");
        }

    }
----

[NOTE]
====
This example contains one constraint, `penalizeEveryShift(...)`.
However, you can include as many as you require.
====

Add the following code to your solver configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <solver xmlns="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver https://timefold.ai/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
      <scoreDirectorFactory>
        <constraintProviderClass>org.acme.schooltimetabling.solver.TimetableConstraintProvider</constraintProviderClass>
      </scoreDirectorFactory>
      ...
    </solver>
----


[#constraintStreamsCardinality]
== Constraint stream cardinality

Constraint stream cardinality is a measure of how many objects a single constraint match consists of.
The simplest constraint stream has a cardinality of 1, meaning each constraint match only consists of 1 object.
Therefore, it is called a `UniConstraintStream`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class) // Returns UniStream<Shift>.
                ...
    }
----

Some constraint stream <<constraintStreamsBuildingBlocks,building blocks>> can increase stream cardinality, such as
<<constraintStreamsJoin,join>> or <<constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors,groupBy>>:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class) // Returns Uni<Shift>.
                .join(Employee.class)       // Returns Bi<Shift, Employee>.
                .join(DayOff.class)         // Returns Tri<Shift, Employee, DayOff>.
                .join(Country.class)        // Returns Quad<Shift, Employee, DayOff, Country>.
                ...
    }
----

The latter can also decrease stream cardinality:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class)             // Returns UniStream<Shift>.
                .join(Employee.class)                   // Returns BiStream<Shift, Employee>.
                .groupBy((shift, employee) -> employee) // Returns UniStream<Employee>.
                ...
    }
----

The following constraint stream cardinalities are currently supported:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Cardinality|Prefix|Defining interface
|1          |   Uni|`UniConstraintStream<A>`
|2          |    Bi|`BiConstraintStream<A, B>`
|3          |   Tri|`TriConstraintStream<A, B, C>`
|4          |  Quad|`QuadConstraintStream<A, B, C, D>`
|===

[#constraintStreamsHigherCardinalities]
=== Achieving higher cardinalities

Timefold Solver currently does not support constraint stream cardinalities higher than 4.
However, with <<constraintStreamsMappingTuples,tuple mapping>> effectively infinite cardinality is possible:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint pentaStreamExample(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class) // UniConstraintStream<Shift>
                .join(Shift.class)          // BiConstraintStream<Shift, Shift>
                .join(Shift.class)          // TriConstraintStream<Shift, Shift, Shift>
                .join(Shift.class)          // QuadConstraintStream<Shift, Shift, Shift, Shift>
                .map(MyTuple::of)           // UniConstraintStream<MyTuple<Shift, Shift, Shift, Shift>>
                .join(Shift.class)          // BiConstraintStream<MyTuple<Shift, Shift, Shift, Shift>, Shift>
                ...                         // This BiConstraintStream carries 5 Shift elements.
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
Timefold Solver does not provide any tuple implementations out of the box.
It's recommended to use one of the freely available 3rd party implementations.
Should a custom implementation be necessary, see <<constraintStreamsDesigningMappingFunction,guidelines for mapping functions>>.
====

[#constraintStreamsBuildingBlocks]
== Building blocks

Constraint streams are chains of different operations, called building blocks.
Each constraint stream starts with a `forEach(...)` building block and is terminated by either a penalty or a reward.
The following example shows the simplest possible constraint stream:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeInitializedShifts(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class)
                .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT)
                .asConstraint("Initialized shift");
    }
----

This constraint stream penalizes each known and initialized instance of `Shift`.

[#constraintStreamsFrom]
[#constraintStreamsForEach]
=== ForEach

The `.forEach(T)` building block selects every `T` instance that
is in a xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#problemFacts[problem fact collection]
or a xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningEntitiesOfASolution[planning entity collection]
and has no `null` genuine planning variables.

To include instances with a `null` xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningVariable[genuine planning variable],
or planning values
not assigned to any xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningListVariable[planning list variable],
replace the `forEach()` building block by `forEachIncludingUnassigned()`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeAllShifts(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEachIncludingUnassigned(Shift.class)
                .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT)
                .asConstraint("A shift");
    }
----

In cases utilizing the xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningListVariable[planning list variable],
you may want
to include an xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#listVariableShadowVariablesInverseRelation[inverse relation shadow variable]
to maximize performance of your constraints.

[NOTE]
====
The `forEach()` building block has a legacy counterpart, `from()`.
This alternative approach included instances based on the initialization status of their genuine planning variables.
As an unwanted consequence,
`from()`
behaves unexpectedly for xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningVariableAllowingUnassigned[variables with unassigned values].
These are considered initialized even when `null`,
and therefore this legacy method could still return entities with `null` variables.
`from()`, `fromUnfiltered()` and `fromUniquePair()` are now deprecated and will be removed in a future major version of Timefold Solver.
====

[#constraintStreamsPenaltiesRewards]
=== Penalties and rewards

The purpose of constraint streams is to build up a xref:constraints-and-score/overview.adoc#whatIsAScore[score] for a xref:using-timefold-solver/modeling-planning-problems.adoc#planningProblemAndPlanningSolution[solution].
To do this, every constraint stream must contain a call to either a `penalize()` or a `reward()`
building block.
The `penalize()` building block makes the score worse and the `reward()` building block improves the score.

Each constraint stream is then terminated by calling `asConstraint()` method, which finally builds the constraint. Constraints have several components:

- Constraint package is the Java package that contains the constraint.
The default value is the package that contains the `ConstraintProvider` implementation or the value from
xref:constraints-and-score/constraint-configuration.adoc#constraintConfiguration[constraint configuration], if implemented.
- Constraint name is the human-readable descriptive name for the constraint, which
(together with the constraint package) must be unique within the entire `ConstraintProvider` implementation.
- Constraint weight is a constant score value indicating how much every breach of the constraint affects the score.
Valid examples include `SimpleScore.ONE`, `HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD` and `HardMediumSoftScore.of(1, 2, 3)`.
- Constraint match weigher is an optional function indicating how many times the constraint weight should be applied in
the score.
The penalty or reward score impact is the constraint weight multiplied by the match weight.
The default value is `1`.

[NOTE]
====
Constraints with zero constraint weight are automatically disabled and do not impose any performance penalty.
====

The Constraint Streams API supports many different types of penalties.
Browse the API in your IDE for the full list of method overloads.
Here are some examples:

- Simple penalty (`penalize(SimpleScore.ONE)`) makes the score worse by `1` per every match in the
constraint stream.
The score type must be the same type as used on the `@PlanningScore` annotated member on the planning solution.
- Dynamic penalty (`penalize(SimpleScore.ONE, Shift::getHours)`) makes the score worse by the number
of hours in every matching `Shift` in the constraint stream.
This is an example of using a constraint match weigher.
- Configurable penalty (`penalizeConfigurable()`) makes the score worse using constraint weights
defined in xref:constraints-and-score/constraint-configuration.adoc#constraintConfiguration[constraint configuration].
- Configurable dynamic penalty(`penalizeConfigurable(Shift::getHours)`) makes the score worse using
constraint weights defined in xref:constraints-and-score/constraint-configuration.adoc#constraintConfiguration[constraint configuration], multiplied by the number of hours in
every matching `Shift` in the constraint stream.

By replacing the keyword `penalize` by `reward` in the name of these building blocks, you get operations that
affect score in the opposite direction.


[#constraintStreamsCustomizingJustificationsAndIndictments]
==== Customizing justifications and indictments

One of important Timefold Solver features is its ability to xref:constraints-and-score/understanding-the-score.adoc[explain the score] of solutions it produced
through the use of justifications and indictments.
By default, each constraint is justified with `ai.timefold.solver.core.api.score.stream.DefaultConstraintJustification`,
and the final tuple makes up the indicted objects.
For example, in the following constraint, the indicted objects will be of type `Vehicle` and an `Integer`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    protected Constraint vehicleCapacity(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Customer.class)
                .filter(customer -> customer.getVehicle() != null)
                .groupBy(Customer::getVehicle, sum(Customer::getDemand))
                .filter((vehicle, demand) -> demand > vehicle.getCapacity())
                .penalizeLong(HardSoftLongScore.ONE_HARD,
                        (vehicle, demand) -> demand - vehicle.getCapacity())
                .asConstraint("vehicleCapacity");
    }
----

For the purposes of creating a xref:constraints-and-score/understanding-the-score.adoc#indictmentHeatMap[heat map], the `Vehicle` is very important, but the naked `Integer` carries no semantics.
We can remove it by providing the `indictWith(...)` method with a custom indictment mapping:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    protected Constraint vehicleCapacity(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Customer.class)
                .filter(customer -> customer.getVehicle() != null)
                .groupBy(Customer::getVehicle, sum(Customer::getDemand))
                .filter((vehicle, demand) -> demand > vehicle.getCapacity())
                .penalizeLong(HardSoftLongScore.ONE_HARD,
                        (vehicle, demand) -> demand - vehicle.getCapacity())
                .indictWith((vehicle, demand) -> List.of(vehicle))
                .asConstraint("vehicleCapacity");
    }
----

The same mechanism can also be used to transform any of the indicted objects to any other object.
To present the constraint matches to the user or to send them over the wire where they can be further processed,
use the `justifyWith(...)` method to provide a custom constraint justification:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    protected Constraint vehicleCapacity(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Customer.class)
                .filter(customer -> customer.getVehicle() != null)
                .groupBy(Customer::getVehicle, sum(Customer::getDemand))
                .filter((vehicle, demand) -> demand > vehicle.getCapacity())
                .penalizeLong(HardSoftLongScore.ONE_HARD,
                        (vehicle, demand) -> demand - vehicle.getCapacity())
                .justifyWith((vehicle, demand, score) ->
                    new VehicleDemandOveruse(vehicle, demand, score))
                .indictWith((vehicle, demand) -> List.of(vehicle))
                .asConstraint("vehicleCapacity");
    }
----

`VehicleDemandOveruse` is a custom type you have to implement.
You have complete control over the type, its name or methods exposed.
If you choose to decorate it with the proper annotations,
you will be able to send it over HTTP or store it in a database.
The only limitation is that it must implement the `ai.timefold.solver.core.api.score.stream.ConstraintJustification` marker interface.


[#constraintStreamsFilter]
=== Filtering

Filtering enables you to reduce the number of constraint matches in your stream.
It first enumerates all constraint matches and then applies a predicate to filter some matches out.
The predicate is a function that only returns `true` if the match is to continue in the stream.
The following constraint stream removes all of Beth's shifts from all `Shift` matches:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeAnnShifts(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class)
                .filter(shift -> shift.getEmployeeName().equals("Ann"))
                .penalize(SimpleScore.ONE)
                .asConstraint("Ann's shift");
    }
----

The following example retrieves a list of shifts where an employee has asked for a day off from a bi-constraint match
of `Shift` and `DayOff`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeShiftsOnOffDays(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Shift.class)
                .join(DayOff.class)
                .filter((shift, dayOff) -> shift.date == dayOff.date && shift.employee == dayOff.employee)
                .penalize(SimpleScore.ONE)
                .asConstraint("Shift on an off-day");
    }
----

The following figure illustrates both these examples:

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamFilter.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
For performance reasons, using the <<constraintStreamsJoin,join>> building block with the appropriate `Joiner` is
preferrable when possible.
Using a `Joiner` creates only the constraint matches that are necessary, while filtered join creates all possible
constraint matches and only then filters some of them out.
====

The following functions are required for filtering constraint streams of different cardinality:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Cardinality|Filtering Predicate
|1          |`java.util.function.Predicate<A>`
|2          |`java.util.function.BiPredicate<A, B>`
|3          |`ai.timefold.solver.core.api.function.TriPredicate<A, B, C>`
|4          |`ai.timefold.solver.core.api.function.QuadPredicate<A, B, C, D>`
|===


[#constraintStreamsJoin]
=== Joining

Joining is a way to increase <<constraintStreamsCardinality,stream cardinality>> and it is similar to the inner join
operation in SQL. As the following figure illustrates,
a `join()` creates a cartesian product of the streams being joined:

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamJoinWithoutJoiners.png[align="center"]

Doing this is inefficient if the resulting stream contains a lot of constraint matches
that need to be filtered out immediately.

Instead, use a `Joiner` condition to restrict the joined matches only to those that are interesting:

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamJoinWithJoiners.png[align="center"]

For example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    import static ai.timefold.solver.core.api.score.stream.Joiners.*;

    ...

    private Constraint shiftOnDayOff(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Shift.class)
                .join(DayOff.class,
                    equal(Shift::getDate, DayOff::getDate),
                    equal(Shift::getEmployee, DayOff::getEmployee))
                .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD)
                .asConstraint("Shift on an off-day");
    }
----

Through the `Joiners` class, the following `Joiner` conditions are supported to join two streams,
pairing a match from each side:

- `equal()`: the paired matches have a property that are `equals()`. This relies on `hashCode()`.
- `greaterThan()`, `greaterThanOrEqual()`, `lessThan()` and `lessThanOrEqual()`:
the paired matches have a `Comparable` property following the prescribed ordering.
- `overlapping()`: the paired matches have two properties (a _start_ and an _end_ property) of the same `Comparable` type
that both represent an interval which overlap.

All `Joiners` methods have an overloaded method to use the same property of the same class on both stream sides.
For example, calling `equal(Shift::getEmployee)` is the same as calling `equal(Shift::getEmployee, Shift::getEmployee)`.

[NOTE]
====
If the other stream might match multiple times, but it must only impact the score once (for each element of the original
stream), use <<constraintStreamsConditionalPropagation,ifExists>> instead.
It does not create cartesian products and therefore generally performs better.
====

==== Evaluation of multiple joiners

When using multiple joiners, there are some important considerations to keep in mind.
Consider the following example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    factory.forEach(VehicleShift.class)
        .join(Visit.class,
            Joiners.equal(Function.identity(), Visit::getVehicleShift), // Visit's VehicleShift is not null...
            Joiners.lessThan(
                    vehicleShift -> vehicleShift.getMaxTravelTime(),
                    visit -> visit.getVehicleShift().getMaxTravelTime() // ... yet NPE may be thrown here.
            ))
----

When indexing joiners (such as `equal()` and `lessThan()`) check their indexes,
they take the input tuple and create a set of keys that will enter the index.
These keys are different for the left and right side of the joiner.

In the above example, from the left side,
the key is `[VehicleShift instance && result of calling VehicleShift.getMaxTravelTime()]`.
(Using the first mapping function of each joiner.)
From the right side,
the key is `[the result of calling Visit.getVehicleShift() && result of calling Visit.getVehicleShift().getMaxTravelTime()]`.
(Using the second mapping function of each joiner.)

However, both of the key mapping functions are calculated independently of the other,
and therefore the `lessThan()` joiner's mapping functions will be executed even in cases
when the `equal()` joiner would not match.
This leads to a `NullPointerException` being thrown in the example above,
where the `lessThan()` joiner's mapping functions are executed on a `Visit` instance
that has a `null` `vehicleShift` property which wasn't (yet) filtered out by the `equal()` joiner.
The filtering only happens inside the joiner's indexes and to access them,
we need these keys to be generated first.

To avoid these issues,
do not assume that subsequent joiners' mapping functions only apply after the previous joiners have matched.
Alternatively (and possibly at the cost of reduced performance) use the filtering joiner,
which is processed differently and does not suffer from this issue:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    factory.forEach(VehicleShift.class)
        .join(Visit.class,
            Joiners.equal(Function.identity(), Visit::getVehicleShift), // Visit's VehicleShift is not null...
            Joiners.filtering((vehicleShift, visit) ->
                vehicleShift.getMaxTravelTime() < visit.getVehicleShift().getMaxTravelTime()
        ))
----


[#constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors]
=== Grouping and collectors

Grouping collects items in a stream according to user-provider criteria (also called "group key"), similar to what a
`GROUP BY` SQL clause does. Additionally, some grouping operations also accept one or more `Collector` instances, which
provide various aggregation functions. The following figure illustrates a simple `groupBy()` operation:

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamGroupBy.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
Objects used as group key must obey the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()[general contract of `hashCode`].
Most importantly, "whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the `hashCode` method must consistently return the same integer."

For this reason, it is not recommended to use mutable objects (especially mutable collections) as group keys.
If planning entities are used as group keys, their hashCode must not be computed off of planning variables.
Failure to follow this recommendation may result in runtime exceptions being thrown.
====

For example, the following code snippet first groups all visits by the vehicle that will be used,
counts them using the `ConstraintCollectors.count(...)` collector,
and finally penalizes every vehicle which makes more than 10 visits:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
import static ai.timefold.solver.core.api.score.stream.ConstraintCollectors.*;

...

private Constraint tooManyVisits(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class)
            .groupBy(Visit::getVehicle, count())
            .filter((vehicle, visitCount) -> visitCount > 10)
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
                    (vehicle, visitCount) -> visitCount - 10)
            .asConstraint("tooManyVisits");
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Information might be lost during grouping.
In the previous example,
`filter()` and all later operations no longer have direct access to the original `Visit` instance.
====

There are many collectors available out of the box.
You can also provide your own collectors by implementing the
`ai.timefold.solver.core.api.score.stream.uni.UniConstraintCollector` interface,
or its `Bi...`, `Tri...` and `Quad...` counterparts.


[#collectorsCount]
==== `count()` collector

The `ConstraintCollectors.count(...)` counts all elements per group. For example, the following use of the collector
gives a number of items for two separate groups - one where the talks have unavailable speakers, and one where they
don't.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
private Constraint speakerAvailability(ConstraintFactory factory) {
    return factory.forEach(Talk.class)
            .groupBy(Talk::hasAnyUnavailableSpeaker, count())
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
                    (hasUnavailableSpeaker, count) -> ...)
            .asConstraint("speakerAvailability");
}
----

The count is collected in an `int`. Variants of this collector:

* `countLong()` collects a `long` value instead of an `int` value.

To count a bi, tri or quad stream, use `countBi()`, `countTri()` or `countQuad()` respectively,
because - unlike the other built-in collectors - they aren't overloaded methods due to Java's generics erasure.


[#collectorsCountDistinct]
==== `countDistinct()` collector

The `ConstraintCollectors.countDistinct(...)` counts any element per group once, regardless of how many times it
occurs. For example, the following use of the collector gives a number of talks in each unique room.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
private Constraint roomCount(ConstraintFactory factory) {
    return factory.forEach(Talk.class)
            .groupBy(Talk::getRoom, countDistinct())
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                    (room, count) -> ...)
            .asConstraint("roomCount");
}
----

The distinct count is collected in an `int`. Variants of this collector:

* `countDistinctLong()` collects a `long` value instead of an `int` value.


[#collectorsSum]
==== `sum()` collector

To sum the values of a particular property of all elements per group,
use the `ConstraintCollectors.sum(...)` collector.
The following code snippet first groups all visits by the vehicle that will be used,
and sums up all the service durations using the `ConstraintCollectors.sum(...)` collector.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
private Constraint totalServiceDuration(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class)
            .groupBy(Visit::getVehicle, sum(Visit::getServiceDuration))
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                    (vehicle, totalServiceDuration) -> totalServiceDuration)
            .asConstraint("totalServiceDuration");
}
----

The sum is collected in an `int`. Variants of this collector:

* `sumLong()` collects a `long` value instead of an `int` value.
* `sumBigDecimal()` collects a `java.math.BigDecimal` value instead of an `int` value.
* `sumBigInteger()` collects a `java.math.BigInteger` value instead of an `int` value.
* `sumDuration()` collects a `java.time.Duration` value instead of an `int` value.
* `sumPeriod()` collects a `java.time.Period` value instead of an `int` value.
* a generic `sum()` variant for summing up custom types


[#collectorsAverage]
==== `average()` collector

To calculate the average of a particular property of all elements per group, use the `ConstraintCollectors.average(...)`
collector.
The following code snippet first groups all visits by the vehicle that will be used,
and sums up all the service durations using the `ConstraintCollectors.sum(...)` collector.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
private Constraint totalServiceDuration(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class)
            .groupBy(Visit::getVehicle, sum(Visit::getServiceDuration))
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                    (vehicle, totalServiceDuration) -> totalServiceDuration)
            .asConstraint("totalServiceDuration");
}
----

The average is collected as a `double`, and the average of no elements is `null`.
Variants of this collector:

* `averageLong()` collects a `long` value instead of an `int` value.
* `averageBigDecimal()` collects a `java.math.BigDecimal` value instead of an `int` value, resulting in a `BigDecimal` average.
* `averageBigInteger()` collects a `java.math.BigInteger` value instead of an `int` value, resulting in a `BigDecimal` average.
* `averageDuration()` collects a `java.time.Duration` value instead of an `int` value, resulting in a `Duration` average.


[#collectorsMinMax]
==== `min()` and `max()` collectors

To extract the minimum or maximum per group, use the `ConstraintCollectors.min(...)` and
`ConstraintCollectors.max(...)` collectors respectively.

These collectors operate on values of properties which are `Comparable` (such as `Integer`, `String` or `Duration`),
although there are also variants of these collectors which allow you to provide your own `Comparator`.

The following code snippet first groups all visits by the vehicle that will be used,
and finds the maximum in the group using the `ConstraintCollectors.sum(...)` collector.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
private Constraint maxServiceDuration(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class)
            .groupBy(Visit::getVehicle, max(Visit::getServiceDuration))
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                    (vehicle, maxServiceDuration) -> maxServiceDuration)
            .asConstraint("maxServiceDuration");
}
----

[NOTE]
====
`Comparator` and `Comparable` implementations used with `min(...)` and `max(...)` constraint collectors are expected to
be consistent with `equals(...)`.
See https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html[Javadoc for `Comparable`] to learn more.
====


[#collectorsCollection]
==== `toList()`, `toSet()` and `toMap()` collectors

To extract all elements per group into a collection, use the `ConstraintCollectors.toList(...)`.

The following example retrieves all visits for a given vehicle in a `List`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
private Constraint vehicleAndItsVisits(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class)
            .groupBy(Visit::getVehicle, toList())
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
                    (vehicle, visitList) -> ...)
            .asConstraint("vehicleAndItsVisits");
}
----

Variants of this collector:

* `toList()` collects a `List` value.
* `toSet()` collects a `Set` value.
* `toSortedSet()` collects a `SortedSet` value.
* `toMap()` collects a `Map` value.
* `toSortedMap()` collects a `SortedMap` value.

[NOTE]
====
The iteration order of elements in the resulting collection is not guaranteed to be stable,
unless it is a sorted collector such as `toSortedSet` or `toSortedMap`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Collecting elements into a `Collection` negates benefits of
xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#incrementalScoreCalculation[incremental score calculation],
as all operations on the resulting `Collection` will no longer be incremental.
If performance is a concern, avoid these collectors.
====


[#collectorsConsecutive]
==== Consecutive collectors

Certain constraints, such as maximum consecutive working days for an employee,
require ordering those shifts in sequences and penalizing sequences exceeding a certain threshold.
If those sequences can be of arbitrary length unknown at the time of writing the constraints,
you can implement this pattern using the `ConstraintCollectors.consecutive(...)` collector:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
Constraint consecutiveWorkingDays(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory.forEach(MinMaxContractLine.class)
        .filter(minMaxContractLine ->
                minMaxContractLine.getContractLineType() == ContractLineType.CONSECUTIVE_WORKING_DAYS
                        && minMaxContractLine.isEnabled())
        .join(ShiftAssignment.class,
                Joiners.equal(ContractLine::getContract, ShiftAssignment::getContract))
        .groupBy((contract, shift) -> shift.getEmployee(),
                (contract, shift) -> contract,
                ConstraintCollectors.toConsecutiveSequences(
                        (contract, shift) -> shift.getShiftDate(),
                        ShiftDate::getDayIndex))
        .flattenLast(SequenceChain::getConsecutiveSequences)
        .map((employee, contract, shifts) -> employee,
                (employee, contract, shifts) -> contract,
                (employee, contract, shifts) -> contract.getViolationAmount(shifts.getLength()))
        .filter((contract, employee, violationAmount) -> violationAmount != 0)
        .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                (contract, employee, violationAmount) -> violationAmount)
        .indictWith((contract, employee, violationAmount) -> Arrays.asList(employee, contract))
        .asConstraint("consecutiveWorkingDays");
}
----

Let's take a closer look at the crucial part of this constraint:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
.groupBy((contract, shift) -> shift.getEmployee(),
        (contract, shift) -> contract,
        ConstraintCollectors.toConsecutiveSequences(
                (contract, shift) -> shift.getShiftDate(),
                ShiftDate::getDayIndex))
.flattenLast(SequenceChain::getConsecutiveSequences)
.map((employee, contract, shifts) -> employee,
        (employee, contract, shifts) -> contract,
        (employee, contract, shifts) -> contract.getViolationAmount(shifts.getLength()))
.filter((contract, employee, violationAmount) -> violationAmount != 0)
----

The `groupBy()` building block groups all shifts by employee and contract,
and for every such pair it creates a `SequenceChain` instance.
The shifts will be put into sequence by their date,
and the day index will be used to identify consecutive sequences and breaks between them.
Imagine the collector putting each shift on a number line,
where the number is the day index of the shift.

The `SequenceChain` then has several useful methods to not only get the list of shifts,
but also to get any and all breaks between those shifts.
In this case, we are only interested in the sequences of shifts themselves,
and we use <<constraintStreamsFlattening,flattening>> to convert each to its own tuple.

Finally, we use <<constraintStreamsMappingTuples,mapping>> to calculate the violation amount for each sequence.
For example, if the contract says that an employee can work at most 5 consecutive days,
and `shifts` contains 6 shifts, then `violationAmount` will be `1`.
If the amount is `0`, then the sequence is not violating the contract and we can filter it out.


[#collectorsConditional]
==== Conditional collectors

The constraint collector framework enables you to create constraint collectors which will only collect in certain circumstances.
This is achieved using the `ConstraintCollectors.conditionally(...)` constraint collector.

This collector accepts a predicate, and another collector to which it will delegate if the predicate is true.
The following example returns a count of long-running visits with assigned to a given vehicle,
where the customer asked for evening delivery:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
private Constraint visitWithEveningDelivery(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class)
            .groupBy(Visit::getVehicle, conditionally(
                    Visit::isEveningDelivery,
                    count()
            ))
            .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
                    (vehicle, eveningDeliveryCount) -> ...)
            .asConstraint("visitWithEveningDelivery");
}
----

This is useful in situations where multiple collectors are used and only some of them need to be restricted.
If all of them needed to be restricted in the same way,
then applying a <<constraintStreamsFilter,`filter()`>> before the grouping is preferable.


[#collectorsComposition]
==== Composing collectors

The constraint collector framework enables you to create complex collectors utilizing simpler ones.
This is achieved using the `ConstraintCollectors.compose(...)` constraint collector.

This collector accepts 2 to 4 other constraint collectors,
and a function to merge their results into one.
The following example builds an <<collectorsAverage,`average()` constraint collector>>
using the <<collectorsCount,`count` constraint collector>> and <<collectorsSum,`sum()` constraint collector>>:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
<A> UniConstraintCollector<A, ?, Double>
    average(ToIntFunction<A> groupValueMapping) {
        return compose(count(), sum(groupValueMapping), (count, sum) -> {
            if (count == 0) {
                return null;
            } else {
                return sum / (double) count;
            }
        });
    }
----

Similarly, the `compose()` collector enables you to work around the limitation of <<constraintStreamsCardinality,Constraint Stream cardinality>>
and use as many as 4 collectors in your <<constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors,`groupBy()` statements>>:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
UniConstraintCollector<A, ?, Triple<Integer, Integer, Integer>> collector =
    compose(count(),
            min(),
            max(),
            (count, min, max) -> Triple.of(count, min, max));
----

Such a composite collector returns a `Triple` instance which allows you to access
each of the sub collectors individually.

[NOTE]
====
Timefold Solver does not provide any `Pair`, `Triple` or `Quadruple` implementation out of the box.
====


[#collectorsAdjusting]
==== Adjusting results

In some cases, you may want to adjust the result that a constraint collector produces.
Consider the <<collectorsAverage,`average()` constraint collector>>:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ConstraintCollectors.average(...)
----

This collector returns `double` values, which may not be suitable for your use case.
For example, you may want to round the result to the nearest integer.
To do this, you can use the `ConstraintCollectors.collectAndThen(...)` collector:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ConstraintCollectors.collectAndThen(
    ConstraintCollectors.average(...),
    doubleValue -> (int) Math.round(doubleValue))
----


[#constraintStreamsConditionalPropagation]
=== Conditional propagation

Conditional propagation enables you to exclude constraint matches from the constraint stream based on the presence or
absence of some other object.

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamIfExists.png[align="center"]

The following example penalizes vehicles which have at least one visit:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint deployedVehicle(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Vehicle.class)
                .ifExists(Visit.class, Joiners.equal(Function.identity(), Visit::getVehicle))
                .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                        vehicle -> ...)
                .asConstraint("deployedVehicle");
    }
----

Note the use of the `ifExists()` building block.
On `UniConstraintStream`, the `ifExistsOther()` building block is also available which is useful in situations where the
`forEach()` constraint match type is the same as the `ifExists()` type.

Conversely, if the `ifNotExists()` building block is used (as well as the `ifNotExistsOther()` building block on
`UniConstraintStream`) you can achieve the opposite effect:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint idleVehicle(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Vehicle.class)
                .ifNotExists(Visit.class, Joiners.equal(Function.identity(), Visit::getVehicle))
                .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                        vehicle -> ...)
                .asConstraint("idleVehicle");
    }
----

Here, only the vehicles without any visits are penalized.

Also note the use of the `Joiner` class to limit the constraint matches.
For a description of available joiners, see <<constraintStreamsJoin,joining>>.
Conditional propagation operates much like joining,
but it does not increase <<constraintStreamsCardinality,stream cardinality>>.
Matches from these building blocks are not available further down the stream.

[NOTE]
====
For performance reasons, using conditional propagation with the appropriate `Joiner` instance is preferable to joining.
While using `join()` creates a cartesian product of the facts being joined, with conditional propagation, the resulting
stream only has at most the original number of constraint matches in it.
Joining should only be used in cases where the other fact is actually required for another operation further down
the stream.
====

[#constraintStreamsMappingTuples]
=== Mapping tuples

Mapping enables you to transform each tuple in a constraint stream by applying a mapping function to it.
The result of such mapping is another constraint stream of the mapped tuples.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint visits(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class) // UniConstraintStream<Visit>
                .map(Visit::getName)                  // UniConstraintStream<String>
                ...
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
In the example above, the mapping function produces duplicate tuples if two different ``Visit``s share a name.
That is, such visit name appears in the resulting constraint stream twice.
See <<constraintStreamsDealingWithDuplicateTuplesUsingDistinct,`distinct()`>> for how to deal with duplicate tuples.
====

Mapping can be used to transform streams of all cardinalities,
and even between cardinalities.
The following example maps a pair of `Visit` instances to a pair of their names:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint visits(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEachUniquePair(Visit.class)                        // BiConstraintStream<Visit, Visit>
                .map((visit1, visit2) -> Pair.of(visit1.getName(), visit2.getName()))  // UniConstraintStream<Pair<String, String>>
                ...
    }
----

[#constraintStreamsDesigningMappingFunction]
==== Designing the mapping function

When designing the mapping function, follow these guidelines for optimal performance:

* Keep the function pure.
The mapping function should only depend on its input.
That is, given the same input, it always returns the same output.
* Keep the function bijective.
No two input tuples should map to the same output tuple, or to tuples that are equal.
Not following this recommendation creates a constraint stream with duplicate tuples,
and may force you to use <<constraintStreamsDealingWithDuplicateTuplesUsingDistinct,`distinct()`>> later.
* Use immutable data carriers.
The tuples returned by the mapping function should be immutable and identified by their contents and nothing else.
If two tuples carry objects which equal one another,
those two tuples should likewise equal and preferably be the same instance.

[#constraintStreamsDealingWithDuplicateTuplesUsingDistinct]
==== Dealing with duplicate tuples using `distinct()`

As a general rule, tuples in constraint streams are distinct.
That is, no two tuples that equal one another.
However, certain operations such as <<constraintStreamsMappingTuples,tuple mapping>> may produce constraint streams
where that is not true.

If a constraint stream produces duplicate tuples, you can use the `distinct()` building block
to have the duplicate copies eliminated.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint visits(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Visit.class) // UniConstraintStream<Visit>
                .map(Visit::getName)                  // UniConstraintStream<String>
                .distinct()                           // The same, each name just once.
                ...
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
There is a performance cost to `distinct()`.
For optimal performance, don't use constraint stream operations that produce duplicate tuples, to avoid the need to call `distinct()`.
====

[#constraintStreamsExpandingTuples]
==== Expanding tuples

Tuple expansion is a special case of <<constraintStreamsMappingTuples,tuple mapping>>
which only increases stream cardinality and can not introduce duplicate tuples.
It enables you to add extra facts to each tuple in a constraint stream by applying a mapping function to it.
This is useful in situations where an expensive computations needs to be cached for use later in the stream.

In the following example,
the method `Talk.prevailingSpeakerUndesiredTimeslotTagCount()` internally iterates over collections to find overlapping tags
and returns the number of such tags.
It is expensive and it is called for each `Talk` in the stream,
possibly being called many thousands of times per second.
Importantly, it is first called to filter out talks that have zero overlap,
and then again to penalize overlap on talks which suffer from it.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    Constraint speakerUndesiredTimeslotTags(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Talk.class)
                .filter(talk -> talk.prevailingSpeakerUndesiredTimeslotTagCount() > 0)
                .penalizeConfigurable(talk -> talk.prevailingSpeakerUndesiredTimeslotTagCount() * talk.getDurationInMinutes())
                .asConstraint(SPEAKER_UNDESIRED_TIMESLOT_TAGS);
    }
----

We can improve this by using tuple expansion to cache the result of the expensive computation,
possibly significantly reducing the number of times it is called.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    Constraint speakerUndesiredTimeslotTags(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Talk.class)
                .expand(Talk::prevailingSpeakerUndesiredTimeslotTagCount)
                .filter((talk, undesiredTagCount) -> undesiredTagCount > 0)
                .penalizeConfigurable((talk, undesiredTagCount) -> undesiredTagCount * talk.getDurationInMinutes())
                .asConstraint(SPEAKER_UNDESIRED_TIMESLOT_TAGS);
    }
----

Once the tuple for a `Talk` has been created and passed through the filter,
the expensive computation will not be reevaluated again unless the `Talk` itself changes.

[NOTE]
====
There is a performance cost to `expand()`.
Always check your solver's score calculation speed to see if the cost is offset by the gains.
====

[#constraintStreamsFlattening]
=== Flattening

Flattening enables you to transform any Java `Iterable` (such as `List` or `Set`)
into a set of tuples, which are sent downstream.
(Similar to Java Stream's `flatMap(...)`.)
This is done by applying a mapping function to the final element in the source tuple.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint requiredJobRoles(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Person.class)              // UniConstraintStream<Person>
                .join(Job.class,
                    equal(Function.identity(), Job::getAssignee))   // BiConstraintStream<Person, Job>
                .flattenLast(Job::getRequiredRoles)                 // BiConstraintStream<Person, Role>
                .filter((person, requiredRole) -> ...)
                ...
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
In the example above, the mapping function produces duplicate tuples
if `Job.getRequiredRoles()` contains duplicate values.
Assuming that the function returns `[USER, USER, ADMIN]`,
the tuple `(SomePerson, USER)` is sent downstream twice.
See <<constraintStreamsDealingWithDuplicateTuplesUsingDistinct,`distinct()`>> for how to deal with duplicate tuples.
====

[#constraintStreamsConcat]
=== Concatenation

The `concat` building block allows you to create a constraint stream containing tuples
of two other constraint streams.
If <<constraintStreamsJoin,join>> acts like a cartesian product of two lists,
`concat` acts like a concatenation of two lists.
Unlike union of sets, concatenation of lists repeats duplicated elements.
If the two constraint concatenating streams share tuples, which happens eg.
when they come from the same source of data,
the tuples will be repeated downstream.
If this is undesired, use the <<constraintStreamsDealingWithDuplicateTuplesUsingDistinct,`distinct` building block>>.

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/constraintStreamConcat.png[align="center"]

For example, to ensure each employee has a minimum number of assigned shifts:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint ensureEachEmployeeHasAtLeastTwoShifts(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Employee.class)
         .join(Shift.class, equal(Function.identity(), Shift::getEmployee))
         .concat(
             constraintFactory.forEach(Employee.class)
               .ifNotExists(Shift.class, equal(Function.identity(), Shift::getEmployee))
         )
         .groupBy((employee, shift) -> employee,
                   conditionally((employee, shift) -> shift != null,
                                 countBi())
         )
         .filter((employee, shiftCount) -> shiftCount < employee.minimumAssignedShifts)
         .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT, (employee, shiftCount) -> employee.minimumAssignedShifts - shiftCount)
         .asConstraint("Minimum number of assigned shifts");
    }
----

This correctly counts the number of shifts each Employee has, *even when the Employee has no shifts*.
Consider the following naive implementation without `concat`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint incorrectEnsureEachEmployeeHasAtLeastTwoShifts(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Employee.class)
         .join(Shift.class, equal(Function.identity(), Shift::getEmployee))
         .groupBy((employee, shift) -> employee,
                  countBi())
         )
         .filter((employee, shiftCount) -> shiftCount < employee.minimumAssignedShifts)
         .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT, (employee, shiftCount) -> employee.minimumAssignedShifts - shiftCount)
         .asConstraint("Minimum number of assigned shifts (incorrect)");
    }
----

An employee with no assigned shifts _wouldn't have been penalized_
because no tuples were passed to the `groupBy` building block.

[#constraintStreamsTesting]
== Testing a constraint stream

We recommend that you test your constraints to ensure that they behave as expected.
Constraint streams include the Constraint Verifier unit testing harness.
To use it, first add a test scoped dependency to the `timefold-solver-test` JAR.


[#constraintStreamsTestingIsolatedConstraints]
=== Testing constraints in isolation

Consider the following constraint stream:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    Constraint vehicleCapacity(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Vehicle.class)
                .filter(vehicle -> vehicle.getTotalDemand() > vehicle.getCapacity())
                .penalizeLong(HardSoftLongScore.ONE_HARD,
                        vehicle -> vehicle.getTotalDemand() - vehicle.getCapacity())
                .asConstraint(VEHICLE_CAPACITY);
    }
----

The following example uses the Constraint Verifier API to create a simple unit test for the preceding constraint stream:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private ConstraintVerifier<VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider, VehicleRoutePlan> constraintVerifier
            = ConstraintVerifier.build(new VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider(), Vehicle.class, Visit.class);

    @Test
    void vehicleCapacity() {
        LocalDateTime tomorrow_07_00 = LocalDateTime.of(TOMORROW, LocalTime.of(7, 0));
        LocalDateTime tomorrow_08_00 = LocalDateTime.of(TOMORROW, LocalTime.of(8, 0));
        LocalDateTime tomorrow_10_00 = LocalDateTime.of(TOMORROW, LocalTime.of(10, 0));
        Vehicle vehicleA = new Vehicle("1", 100, LOCATION_1, tomorrow_07_00);
        Visit visit1 = new Visit("2", "John", LOCATION_2, 80, tomorrow_08_00, tomorrow_10_00, Duration.ofMinutes(30L));
        vehicleA.getVisits().add(visit1);
        Visit visit2 = new Visit("3", "Paul", LOCATION_3, 40, tomorrow_08_00, tomorrow_10_00, Duration.ofMinutes(30L));
        vehicleA.getVisits().add(visit2);

        constraintVerifier.verifyThat(VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider::vehicleCapacity)
                .given(vehicleA, visit1, visit2)
                .penalizesBy(20);
    }
----

This test ensures that, if a vehicle capacity is exceeded, that the constraint penalizes accordingly.
The following line creates a shared `ConstraintVerifier` instance and initializes the instance with the
`VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider`:


[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private ConstraintVerifier<VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider, VehicleRoutePlan> constraintVerifier
            = ConstraintVerifier.build(new VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider(), Vehicle.class, Visit.class);
----

The `@Test` annotation indicates that the method is a unit test in a testing framework of your choice.
Constraint Verifier works with many testing frameworks including JUnit and AssertJ.

The first part of the test prepares the test data.
In this case, the test data includes a vehicle and a visit:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        Vehicle vehicleA = new Vehicle("1", 100, LOCATION_1, tomorrow_07_00);
        Visit visit1 = new Visit("2", "John", LOCATION_2, 80, tomorrow_08_00, tomorrow_10_00, Duration.ofMinutes(30L));
        vehicleA.getVisits().add(visit1);
        Visit visit2 = new Visit("3", "Paul", LOCATION_3, 40, tomorrow_08_00, tomorrow_10_00, Duration.ofMinutes(30L));
        vehicleA.getVisits().add(visit2);
----

Further down, the following code tests the constraint:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        constraintVerifier.verifyThat(VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider::vehicleCapacity)
                .given(vehicleA, visit1, visit2)
                .penalizesBy(20);
----

The `verifyThat(...)` call is used to specify a method on the `VehicleRoutingConstraintProvider` class which is under test.
This method must be visible to the test class, which the Java compiler enforces.

The `given(...)` call is used to enumerate all the facts that the constraint stream operates on.
In this case, the `given(...)` call takes the `vehicleA`, `visit1` and `visit2` instances previously created.
Alternatively, you can use a `givenSolution(...)` method here and provide a planning solution instead.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use methods `justifiesWith(...)` and `indictsWith(...)`
to validate the expected constraint justifications and indictments mapped by the constraint definition.
====

Finally, the `penalizesBy(...)` call completes the test,
making sure that the given constraint under the given conditions penalizes by the `20`.
This number is a product of multiplying the match weight, as defined in the constraint stream, by the number of matches.

Alternatively, you can use a `rewardsWith(...)` call to check for rewards instead of penalties.
The method to use here depends on whether the constraint stream in question is terminated with a `penalize` or a
`reward` building block.

[NOTE]
====
`ConstraintVerifier` does not trigger variable listeners.
It will neither set nor update shadow variables.
If the tested constraints depend on shadow variables,
it is your responsibility to assign the correct values beforehand.

When executing `justifiesWith(...)` and `indictsWith(...)`,
comparisons are made using the standard method `equals` on the fact problem instances.
====

[#constraintStreamsTestingAllConstraints]
=== Testing all constraints together

In addition to testing individual constraints, you can test the entire `ConstraintProvider` instance.
Consider the following test:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    @Test
    public void givenFactsMultipleConstraints() {
        LocalDateTime tomorrow_07_00 = LocalDateTime.of(TOMORROW, LocalTime.of(7, 0));
        LocalDateTime tomorrow_08_00 = LocalDateTime.of(TOMORROW, LocalTime.of(8, 0));
        LocalDateTime tomorrow_10_00 = LocalDateTime.of(TOMORROW, LocalTime.of(10, 0));
        Vehicle vehicleA = new Vehicle("1", 100, LOCATION_1, tomorrow_07_00);
        Visit visit1 = new Visit("2", "John", LOCATION_2, 80, tomorrow_08_00, tomorrow_10_00, Duration.ofMinutes(30L));
        vehicleA.getVisits().add(visit1);
        Visit visit2 = new Visit("3", "Paul", LOCATION_3, 40, tomorrow_08_00, tomorrow_10_00, Duration.ofMinutes(30L));
        vehicleA.getVisits().add(visit2);

        constraintVerifier.verifyThat()
                .given(vehicleA, visit1, visit2)
                .scores(HardSoftScore.ofSoft(20));
    }
----

There are only two notable differences to the previous example.

- The `verifyThat()` call takes no argument here, signifying that the entire `ConstraintProvider` instance is
being tested.
(But for the sake of simplicity, we will assume it still only contains the one constraint we've seen previously.)
- Instead of either a `penalizesBy()` or `rewardsWith()` call, the `scores(...)` method is used.
This runs the `ConstraintProvider` on the given facts and returns a sum of ``Score``s of all constraint matches resulting
from the given facts.

Using this method, you ensure that the constraint provider does not miss any constraints and that the scoring function
remains consistent as your code base evolves.
It is therefore necessary for the `given(...)` method to list all planning entities and problem facts,
or provide the entire planning solution instead.

[NOTE]
====
`ConstraintVerifier` does not trigger variable listeners.
It will neither set nor update shadow variables.
If the tested constraints depend on shadow variables,
it is your responsibility to assign the correct values beforehand.

[#constraintStreamsTestingQuarkus]
=== Testing in Quarkus

If you are using the `timefold-solver-quarkus` extension, inject the `ConstraintVerifier` in your tests:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class MyConstraintProviderTest {
    @Inject
    ConstraintVerifier<MyConstraintProvider, MyPlanningSolution> constraintProvider;
}
----

[#constraintStreamsTestingSpringBoot]
=== Testing in Spring Boot

If you are using the `timefold-solver-spring-boot-starter` module, autowire the `ConstraintVerifier` in your tests:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@SpringBootTest
public class MyConstraintProviderTest {
    @Autowired
    ConstraintVerifier<MyConstraintProvider, MyPlanningSolution> constraintProvider;
}
----

[#otherTypesOfScoreCalculation]
== Other types of score calculation

Timefold Solver supports two other types of score calculation.

[#easyJavaScoreCalculation]
=== Easy Java score calculation

An easy way to implement your score calculation in Java.

* Advantages:
** Plain old Java: no learning curve.
** Opportunity to delegate score calculation to an existing code base or legacy system.
** Useful for prototyping.
* Disadvantages:
** Slower, typically not suitable for production.
** Does not scale because there is no xref:constraints-and-score/performance.adoc#incrementalScoreCalculation[incremental score calculation].
** Can not xref:constraints-and-score/understanding-the-score.adoc[explain the score].

To start using Easy Java score calculation, implement the one method of the interface ``EasyScoreCalculator``:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface EasyScoreCalculator<Solution_, Score_ extends Score<Score_>> {

    Score_ calculateScore(Solution_ solution);

}
----

Configure it in the solver configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <easyScoreCalculatorClass>...MyEasyScoreCalculator</easyScoreCalculatorClass>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----

To configure values of an `EasyScoreCalculator` dynamically in the solver configuration
(so the xref:using-timefold-solver/benchmarking-and-tweaking.adoc#benchmarker[Benchmarker] can tweak those parameters),
add the `easyScoreCalculatorCustomProperties` element and use xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#customPropertiesConfiguration[custom properties]:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <easyScoreCalculatorClass>...MyEasyScoreCalculator</easyScoreCalculatorClass>
    <easyScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
      <property name="myCacheSize" value="1000" />
    </easyScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----


[#incrementalJavaScoreCalculation]
=== Incremental Java score calculation

A way to implement your score calculation incrementally in Java.

* Advantages:
** Very fast and scalable; currently the fastest if implemented correctly.
* Disadvantages:
** Hard to write
*** A scalable implementation heavily uses maps, indexes etc.
You have to learn, design, write and improve all these performance optimizations yourself.
Why not have <<constraintStreams,constraint streams>> do the hard work for you?
** Hard to read
*** Regular score constraint changes can lead to high maintenance costs.

To start using Incremental Java score calculation,
implement all the methods of the interface `IncrementalScoreCalculator`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface IncrementalScoreCalculator<Solution_, Score_ extends Score<Score_>> {

    void resetWorkingSolution(Solution_ workingSolution);

    void beforeEntityAdded(Object entity);

    void afterEntityAdded(Object entity);

    void beforeVariableChanged(Object entity, String variableName);

    void afterVariableChanged(Object entity, String variableName);

    void beforeEntityRemoved(Object entity);

    void afterEntityRemoved(Object entity);

    Score_ calculateScore();

}
----

image::constraints-and-score/score-calculation/incrementalScoreCalculatorSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

Configure it in the solver configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <incrementalScoreCalculatorClass>...MyIncrementalScoreCalculator</incrementalScoreCalculatorClass>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Incremental score calculator code can be difficult to write and to review.
xref:constraints-and-score/overview.adoc#invalidScoreDetection[Assert its correctness] by using an ``EasyScoreCalculator`` to fulfill
the assertions triggered by the ``environmentMode``.
====

To configure values of an `IncrementalScoreCalculator` dynamically in the solver configuration
(so the xref:using-timefold-solver/benchmarking-and-tweaking.adoc#benchmarker[Benchmarker] can tweak those parameters),
add the `incrementalScoreCalculatorCustomProperties` element and use xref:using-timefold-solver/configuration.adoc#customPropertiesConfiguration[custom properties]:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <incrementalScoreCalculatorClass>...MyIncrementalScoreCalculator</incrementalScoreCalculatorClass>
    <incrementalScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
      <property name="myCacheSize" value="1000"/>
    </incrementalScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----


[#constraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator]
==== `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`

To add support for xref:constraints-and-score/understanding-the-score.adoc[score analysis],
optionally also implement the `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator` interface:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator<Solution_, Score_ extends Score<Score_>> {

    void resetWorkingSolution(Solution_ workingSolution, boolean constraintMatchEnabled);

    Collection<ConstraintMatchTotal<Score_>> getConstraintMatchTotals();

    Map<Object, Indictment<Score_>> getIndictmentMap();
}
----

Typically it means creating one `ConstraintMatchTotal` per constraint type
and calling `addConstraintMatch()` for each constraint match.
`getConstraintMatchTotals()` code often duplicates some logic of the normal `IncrementalScoreCalculator` methods.
Constraint Streams doesn't have this disadvantage, because they are aware of constraint matches by design,
without any extra domain-specific code.
