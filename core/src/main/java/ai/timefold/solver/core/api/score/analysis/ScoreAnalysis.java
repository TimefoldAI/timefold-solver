/**
 * Represents the breakdown of a {@link Score} into individual {@link ConstraintAnalysis} instances,
 * one for each constraint.
 * Compared to {@link ScoreExplanation}, this is JSON-friendly and faster to generate.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to be fully serializable to JSON, {@link MatchAnalysis} instances must be serializable to JSON
 * and that requires any implementations of {@link ConstraintJustification} to be serializable to JSON.
 * This is the responsibility of the user.
 *
 * <p>
 * For deserialization from JSON, the user needs to provide the deserializer themselves.
 * This is due to the fact that, once the {@link ScoreAnalysis} is received over the wire,
 * we no longer know which {@link Score} type or {@link ConstraintJustification} type was used.
 * The user has all of that information in their domain model,
 * and so they are the correct party to provide the deserializer.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: the constructors of this record are off-limits.
 * We ask users to use exclusively {@link SolutionManager#analyze(Object)} to obtain instances of this record.
 *
 * @param score never null
 * @param constraintMap never null;
 *        for each constraint identified by its {@link Constraint#getConstraintRef()},
 *        the {@link ConstraintAnalysis} that describes the impact of that constraint on the overall score.
 *        Constraints are present even if they have no matches, unless their weight is zero;
 *        zero-weight constraints are not present.
 *        Entries in the map have a stable iteration order; items are ordered first by {@link ConstraintAnalysis#weight()},
 *        then by {@link ConstraintAnalysis#constraintRef()}.
