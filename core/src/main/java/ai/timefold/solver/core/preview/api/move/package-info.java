/**
 * This package contains classes and interfaces that are used to write moves to explore the neighborhood of a
 * {@link ai.timefold.solver.core.api.domain.solution.PlanningSolution}.
 * It will eventually replace the move selector framework.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>This package and all of its contents are part of the Move Streams API,
 * which is under development and is only offered as a preview feature.</strong>
 * There are no guarantees for backward compatibility;
 * any class, method, or field may change or be removed without prior notice,
 * although we will strive to avoid this as much as possible.
 * <p>
 * We encourage you to try the API and give us feedback on your experience with it,
 * before we finalize the API.
 * Please direct your feedback to
 * <a href="https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver/discussions">Timefold Solver Github</a>.
