/**
 * This package contains classes and interfaces that represent the metamodel of the domain.
 * This meta-model describes the planning solution, its entities and their variables,
 * typically for use within {@link ai.timefold.solver.core.preview.api.move.Move}s
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>This package and all of its contents are part of the Move Streams API,
 * which is under development and is only offered as a preview feature.</strong>
 * There are no guarantees for backward compatibility;
 * any class, method, or field may change or be removed without prior notice,
 * although we will strive to avoid this as much as possible.
 * <p>
 * We encourage you to try the API and give us feedback on your experience with it,
 * before we finalize the API.
