# Axioms of the release pipeline:
# - Each release starts from timefold-solver by running this Github Action.
# - Each individual repository can only start its own release when its dependencies are fully released.
#   timefold-solver-enterprise depends on timefold-solver
#   timefold-quickstarts depends on timefold-solver
#   timefold-website releases last
# - Each individual repository uses 999-SNAPSHOT as its development version, even on micro branches.
#
# Should any of these axioms change, the release pipeline will need to be (significantly) refactored.
# 0.8.x releases existed before this pipeline; they are done differently, similarities are coincidental.
