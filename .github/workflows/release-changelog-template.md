# How to use Timefold Solver

To see Timefold Solver in action, check out [the quickstarts](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts).

[//]: # (Ideally we'd show the pom.xml snippet, but a JReleaser bug would remove all whitespace from it.)
[//]: # (See https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/issues/1142)
With Maven or Gradle, add the `ai.timefold.solver : timefold-solver-core : {{projectVersion}}` dependency in your `pom.xml` to get started.

You can also import the Timefold Solver Bom (`ai.timefold.solver : timefold-solver-bom : {{projectVersion}}`) 
to avoid duplicating version numbers when adding other Timefold Solver dependencies later on.
