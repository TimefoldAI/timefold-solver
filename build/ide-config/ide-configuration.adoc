= IDE code style setup

Every Maven build formats the source code with the standard code style.
This avoids merge conflicts and code style discussions.

Configure it in your favorite IDE too:

== IDEA setup

. Open the _Settings_ window (or _Preferences_ depending on your edition) and navigate to _Plugins_.

. Install the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546-eclipse-code-formatter[Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin] from the IntelliJ Marketplace.

. Restart your IDE.

. Open the _Settings_ window again and navigate to _Other Settings -> Eclipse Code Formatter_.

. Select _Use the Eclipse Code Formatter_

. Change the _Eclipse Java Formatter Config File_ to point to the `eclipse-format.xml`
file in the `build/ide-config/src/main/resources/` directory.

. Make sure the _Optimize Imports_ box is ticked

. select the `eclipse.importorder` file as the import order config file.

. Open the _Editor -> Code Style -> Java -> Imports_ settings and set the _Class count to use import with '\*'_ to 999. This is to avoid the `*` imports, which should only be used in special cases.

== Eclipse setup

. Open the _Preferences_ window, and then navigate to _Java -> Code Style -> Formatter_.

. Click _Import_ and then select the `build/ide-config/src/main/resources/eclipse-format.xml` file in the `ide-configuration` directory.

. Navigate to _Java -> Code Style -> Organize Imports_.

. Click Import and select the `build/ide-config/src/main/resources/eclipse.importorder` file.

== VS Code setup

. Open the _Extensions_ window (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for _Language Support for Java(TM)_ and install it.

. Create a settings file for your workspace
