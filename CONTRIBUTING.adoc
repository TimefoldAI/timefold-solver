=== Build the Timefold Solver project

Use one of the following ways to build this project:

* :rocket: *build-fast*: `mvn clean install -Dquickly` skips any checks and code analysis (~1 min)

* :hammer: *build-normally*: `mvn clean install` runs tests, checks code style, skips documentation (~17 min)

* :receipt: *build-doc*: `mvn clean install` in the `docs` directory creates asciidoctor documentation `docs/target/html_single/index.html` (~2 min)

* :mechanical_arm: *build-all*: `mvn clean install -Dfull` runs all checks and creates documentation and distribution files (~20 min)


=== Set up your development environment

. To develop with IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or VSCode, open the root `pom.xml` as a new project
and configure a _Run/Debug configuration_ like this:
+
* Type: Application
* Main class: `ai.timefold.solver.examples.app.TimefoldExamplesApp`
* VM options: `-Xmx2G` (memory only needed when using the big datasets in the examples)
* Program arguments: (none)
* Working directory: `$MODULE_DIR$` (must resolve to `examples` directory)
* Use classpath of module: `timefold-solver-examples`


=== Code style

Your code is automatically formatted according to the _Import and Code Style_ conventions during every Maven build. CI checks enforce those conventions too, so be sure to build your project with maven before creating your PR:
----
mvn clean install
----
For information about how to set up code style checks, see https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver/blob/main/build/ide-config/ide-configuration.adoc[IDE Setup Instructions].

[#commit-messages]
=== Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

We use link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional Commits] for PR titles and commit messages.
The following prefixes are allowed:

- `feat` for changes that add new features,
- `fix` for changes that fix bugs,
- `docs` for changes that only affect documentation,
- `perf` for changes that improve performance,
- `test` for adding missing tests or correcting existing tests,
- `build` for changes that affect the build system or external dependencies,
- `ci` for changes to our CI configuration files and scripts,
- `revert` for reverting previous changes,
- `deps` for updates to dependencies (mostly used by Dependabot),
- `chore` for any other changes.

This convention is enforced by CI checks on pull requests.
